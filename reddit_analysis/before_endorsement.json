            "For those confused what the crime here was, I wrote this:\n\nIt's important to note here, that paying hush money is not illegal.  Paying hush money to bury a story is not illegal.  Paying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign is not illegal.\n\nPaying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign and failing to report it to the Federal Election Commission, when the political campaign is for President of the United States *is* illegal.\n\nFalsifying business records to hide the purpose of that money and evade the mandatory reporting to the FEC is a crime in the state of New York.  \n\nThe issue is more subtle.  It's not that he paid hush money, it's that he doctored, and instructed others to doctor, business records in New York State to hide the (totally legal) use of funds in order to conceal the actual purpose of paying those funds, in order to evade the requirement that he report those funds to the FEC.  \n\nIt would have been totally legal for Trump to have paid Daniels for her story, and paid her not to talk about it in the press.  And if he did those purely for personal reasons (like to save his family the embarrassment) he wouldn't have really needed to disclose them to anyone.  But if he paid those funds to increase his odds of winning the Presidential election he was legally mandated to report those funds to the FEC.  The jury found, based on the evidence presented, that those funds were paid to increase his chances to win the presidental election, not for any personal reasons.  They likewise found he failed to report the payment of those funds to the FEC, which is a crime, but it's a federal crime and not one the State of New York has jurisdiction over.  \n\nThe jury further found that he doctored business records in order to conceal the fact that he committed a crime by failing to report the spending of campaign-related funds to the FEC.  Doctoring business records to conceal a crime is, in and of itself, a crime in the State of New York.  That's what he's convicted for.\n\nEssentially the jury found:\n\n* 1)  Trump paid, and directed others to pay certain funds used to induce people to to either purchase rights to stories in order to bury them, or to not disclose what they saw or knew (this is legal)\n* 2)  The purpose of those funds was to prevent unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye (also legal)\n* 3)  The purpose of attempting to prevent those unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye was to influence the 2016 Presidential Election (ALSO legal)\n* 4)  Trump failed to disclose the spending of those funds, spent with the intent of influencing the 2016 Presidential Election to the Federal Election Commission (illegal, but that's a federal crime, and one the state of New York has no jurisdiction to prosecute over)\n* 5)  Trump doctored, or directed others to doctor, business records of his New York based business to hide the true purpose of those funds (this is a misdemeanor in the state of new york)\n* 6)  The purpose behind doctoring those records was to conceal the fact that Trump committed a crime by failing to report the payment of those funds to the FEC (the failure to do so is a federal crime)\n* 7)  Doctoring business records in NY for the purposes of concealing a crime (any crime, state or federal) elevates the misdemeanor to a felony\n* 8)  Trump did this 34 times.",

            "**Convicted Felon Donald Trump**\n\nWe still have a few weeks to hear sentencing, and he will undoubtedly appeal, which could last well into 2025.\n\nBut that's not what is important today.\n\nThis IS history. Polling saying voters are partisan and unmoved doesn't make it any less significant.\n\nFor starters, it's not a \"hush money\" case, as the media has latched onto. It's an *election interference* case, and these are *felonies.*\n\nHe worked to illegally cover up stories that could have easily swung the 2016 election, which was won by a few thousand votes in a few states, and could have altered the course of American history. It encapsulates everything about Trump and is the beginning to his criminal history saga regarding the Presidency.\n\nIt is hopefully only the beginning of his criminal accountability, and a necessary step forward for democracy, the rule of law, and us as a country.\n\nIn summary, I'm opening up some fine bourbon tonight.",

            "the most important thing about this trial was that it happened at all.\n\ncommenced, proceeded, concluded, just like thousands of other trials.\n\nkudos to the DA and prosecutors, the judge, the jury, court officers, and NYPD",

            "Been a prosecutor, been a defense attorney. Best thing Trump can do right now is shut up and show contrition. He is a nearly 80 year old man, likely suffering from dementia, with no record (before today \ud83d\ude01) who can likely avoid jail time if he just acts remotely normal. \n\nOf course, this is a man who would\u2019ve coasted to re-election if he just acted like a normal president during COVID. \n\nBut I digress, instead he is going to use this press conference tomorrow to attack the prosecutors, the judge, the judge\u2019s daughter, the jury, the witnesses, the Biden administration, Trump\u2019s defense team, Mike Pence, the Taco Bell dog and really anyone else who pops into his demented old head. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t see how any judge doesn\u2019t give him jail time after that.  Acceptance of responsibility is a huge deal when it comes to sentencing. And Trump, claiming to be a Christian, literally said he cannot thing of a single time he\u2019s ever had to ask God for forgiveness or repent. He\u2019s not going to accept responsibility. He\u2019s not going to be contrite. He\u2019s going to give Merchan no choice but to sentence him to jail. \n\nAnd I am here for it.",

            "trump posted: trump says \u201cNot only did this HIGHLY CONFLICTED, BIASED Judge, Juan Merchan, prevent me from presenting the fact that I did not take a Tax Deduction on the Legal Expense (which was marked, correctly, as a Legal Expense), the Judge also did not allow my lawyers to get Tax Records from the former attorney, whose name I am not allowed to mention due to the UnConstitutional Gag Order imposed upon me. ELECTION INTERFERENCE! WITCH HUNT!\u201d\n\nhere\u2019s the facts: Donald Trump's statement contains several inaccuracies and misleading claims. Here is a fact-check based on the provided sources:\n\n### Claim 1: \"Judge Juan Merchan prevented me from presenting the fact that I did not take a Tax Deduction on the Legal Expense.\"\n- **Fact**: Judge Merchan did not prevent Trump from presenting evidence related to tax deductions. The judge's instructions to the jury included explanations about what constitutes falsifying business records and the intent to defraud, which involves the intent to commit or conceal another crime, such as tax fraud[8][11][18]. There is no indication that Trump was barred from presenting specific evidence about tax deductions.\n\n### Claim 2: \"The Legal Expense (which was marked, correctly, as a Legal Expense).\"\n- **Fact**: The prosecution argued that the payments to Michael Cohen were falsely labeled as legal expenses to conceal their true nature as reimbursements for hush money payments to Stormy Daniels[15][19]. The jury found Trump guilty of falsifying business records, indicating they did not accept the defense's argument that the expenses were correctly marked[15].\n\n### Claim 3: \"The Judge also did not allow my lawyers to get Tax Records from the former attorney.\"\n- **Fact**: There is no evidence that Judge Merchan prevented Trump's lawyers from obtaining tax records from Michael Cohen. The judge did limit the testimony of certain witnesses, such as former Federal Election Commission chairman Bradley Smith, but this was related to the scope of their testimony, not the ability to obtain records[4][5][10].\n\n### Claim 4: \"I am not allowed to mention due to the UnConstitutional Gag Order imposed upon me.\"\n- **Fact**: The gag order imposed by Judge Merchan restricts Trump from making public statements about potential witnesses, jurors, court employees, or their families to ensure a fair trial and protect the safety of those involved[2][3][14]. This order has been upheld by the appellate court, which found it to be a necessary measure to balance Trump's free speech rights with the need for a fair trial[2][3].\n\n### Claim 5: \"ELECTION INTERFERENCE! WITCH HUNT!\"\n- **Fact**: Trump has repeatedly claimed that the charges against him are politically motivated and constitute election interference. However, the prosecution and the court have maintained that the charges are based on evidence and legal principles, not political bias[1][2][3][15]. The jury's unanimous guilty verdict further supports the legitimacy of the legal process[15].\n\nIn summary, Trump's claims about Judge Merchan's actions and the nature of the trial are not supported by the facts. The judge's rulings and the gag order were implemented to ensure a fair trial and protect the integrity of the judicial process.\n\nSources\n[1] Judge refuses to gag Trump in classified docs case, says special ... https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-attorneys-allege-unconstitutional-censorship-special-counsel-gag-order-request\n[2] Court Rejects Trump's Gag Order Appeal - Forbes https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2024/05/14/trumps-gag-order-upheld-in-hush-money-case-after-appeal-is-rejected/\n[3] Donald Trump's Newest Gag Order Has Key Difference Than Previous https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-new-gag-order-key-difference-1883837\n[4] Fact check: Trump delivers flurry of false and misleading claims as ... https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/30/politics/fact-check-trump-false-claims-trial/index.html\n[5] The Latest | Judge excuses jurors, ending first day of deliberations in ... https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/latest-trumps-criminal-trial-enter-deliberations-phase-after-110634720\n[6] Who is Juan Merchan, the judge in Trump's criminal hush-money trial? https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/29/juan-merchan-donald-trump\n[7] Analysis-For Trump's False Records Charges, Prison Is Rare but Not ... https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-05-30/analysis-for-trumps-false-records-charges-prison-is-rare-but-not-unprecedented\n[8] READ: Jury instructions from judge in the Trump hush money trial https://www.wbaltv.com/article/read-jury-instructions-trump-trial/60939715\n[9] Trump trial highlights: Hush money judge holds hearing ... - NBC News https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/trump-trial-hush-money-case-live-updates-rcna149907\n[10] A verdict has been reached in Trump's New York trial - NPR https://www.npr.org/2024/05/30/nx-s1-4977352/trump-trial-verdict\n[11] What is the New York election law at the center of Trump's hush ... https://consent.yahoo.com/v2/collectConsent?sessionId=1_cc-session_fd0546fb-ff42-4d61-803d-6e58c8028c55\n[12] SENATOR VANCE: NEW YORK TRUMP TRIAL IS JUST ANOTHER ... https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-vance-new-york-trump-trial-is-just-another-partisan-witch-hunt/\n[13] Democrats' Corrupt And Desperate Witch Hunts Against President ... https://stefanik.house.gov/2024/4/icymi-chairwoman-stefanik-democrats-corrupt-and-desperate-witch-hunts-against-president-trump-must-come-to-an-end\n[14] Judge finds Donald Trump in contempt for 10th time over gag order ... https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/06/politics/merchan-trump-gag-order-contempt/index.html\n[15] A verdict has been reached in Trump's New York trial and will be ... https://www.wusf.org/2024-05-30/former-president-trump-is-found-guilty-in-historic-new-york-criminal-case\n[16] False right-wing reports about Trump trial jury instructions fuel ... https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/false-right-wing-reports-trump-trial-jury-instructions-fuel-threats-ju-rcna154678\n[17] Trump trial live updates: Verdict reached in historic case - ABC News https://abcnews.go.com/US/live-updates/trump-hush-money-trial/trump-team-hoping-for-a-hung-jury-say-sources-110671909?id=110586765\n[18] Trump's hush money case has gone to the jury.

He isn't an average defendant, this isn't an average crime, and Judge Merchan has a truly historic opportunity to realize an oft-spoken but less frequently realized aspiration of the justice system: no-one is above the law. Putting Trump away for even a few months will set an example for decades or centuries to come.\n\nWhat comes next is this: Trump is going to lose the 2024 election. He was on shaky ground before this verdict and his chances won't survive the label of 'convicted felon.' Soon, mercifully, Donald Trump won't be our problem. \n\nBut we aren't free of problems. We will need to reckon - and it will be *difficult* - with the reality that even as a felon, Trump will win many states and pull many tens of millions of votes. Those voters are our problem. They live outside of reality, willfully locked in a bubble of resentment and commercialized fear-mongering, and they will find another Donald Trump. Until as a country we're able to heal our polity, to bring these voters back to something that approximates reality, the danger hasn't passed.",

I think that's what was concurrently happening for many years but we'll likely hear of it from the people running it. \n\n\nHe overpaid but for a tool of social control that can be very dangerous and harmful or helpful, depending upon how much you value any human life, any person influenced by social media content, and whether their lives are more than consumption, indoctrination, etc. \n\n\nBut, I would rather not waste my time writing about or on these networks for free ever, again. Yes, to learn, and Reddit is also the same... but they should actually be investigating X, Meta, etc. to see how they support a lot of claims people have had about people, businesses, institutions, etc., where they could not get their needs met. Absolutely fascinating and better approach to focus on rather than whatever these guys want. \n\n\nBut, they just want a mirror that loves them, imo.

My social politics are definitely not conservative. I voted for Biden in 2020 because of social politics.  Big mistake. Huge. Why? Because he has done absolutely nothing except divide us.

And many cry on social media when they have been misgendered. \n\nI am called racist because I have an American flag.

We're a nation that has not managed to take care of it's people yet we are letting illegal people in? What other nation in this world allows illegal immigration and does nothing to protect our borders.

Gas was cheaper, groceries were cheaper, interest rates weren't ridiculous. I've never been a huge trump supporter but I am now. They can't buy him. He's a billionaire.

Trump has gone from +4 in Pennsylvania to +10. \n\nSecondly, and most troubling, every single high-ranking Democrat Ezra spoke to expressed doubts about Biden's chances of winning, but they are unwilling to vocalize these concerns publicly due to fear of backlash from the party. \n\nI understand your frustration with the media shaping reality instead of reporting it, but it seems like we are currently headed for defeat.",

And many cry on social media when they have been misgendered. \n\nI am called racist because I have an American flag.

We're a nation that has not managed to take care of it's people yet we are letting illegal people in? What other nation in this world allows illegal immigration and does nothing to protect our borders.

            "Three things to point out here.\n\n1. SCOTUS could have chosen not to take up the immunity case at all, especially since the DC Circuit issued a bulletproof opinion which was unanimous.\n\n2. If SCOTUS wanted to hear the immunity case, they could've of taken it up two months earlier when Jack Smith requested that they hear it without it going to the DC Circuit Appeals Court first.\n\n3. The Colorado ballot case was on a faster timeline.  Arguments in that case occurred only a month after they granted cert, and the opinion came out only a month later.  \n\nIn addition, the recent revelations regarding Alito's flags further prove that SCOTUS is helping Trump delay the trial.  But anyway, I hope that you, at least, aren't someone that believes that Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson even voted in Feb. to hear the immunity case and even voted to not have the oral arguments until late April.  This is especially considering the fact that I now believe that at least the former and latter were in opposition.\n\nRegarding Cannon, I definitely agree with you.  As a matter of fact, I knew the case was toast when it was assigned to her given her controversial ruling that got overturned by the 11th Circuit.  I wasn't surprised when Cannon announced she was indefinitely delaying the trial.  The only thing surprising is how 12 Democrats in the Senate voted to confirm Cannon, especially when they confirmed her after the 2020 election.",
            "One, it was a question that needed to be definitively answered, and no case is bulletproof. Also, the 4th Circuit shot down Bianchi v. Frosh per curiam, and then the Supreme Court told them wrong, try that again (GVR). Unanimous means nothing when they're wrong (I think DC was right, but that's irrelevant). \n\nTwo, this was the case that was appealed to them on this issue. The Supreme Court rarely hears cases out of districts, preferring to let them go through circuits first. Smith was asking for something unusual. \n\nThree, different schedules, different argument dates. \n\nAlito's flags prove nothing. \n\nWhat made me think Cannon may be just incompetent was hearing that she made stupid mistakes in other cases too. So I'm sure incompetence is still part of this case, but there's definitely strong evidence for her trying to help Trump too.",
            "I know the Colorado ballot case and immunity cases are two separate issues, but the point I was trying to make was that arguments in Colorado ballot case took place only a month after SCOTUS granted cert. in that case.  Therefore, SCOTUS could've heard arguments for the immunity case in March, but they decided to sit on it until the end of April even though the immunity case is a much easier issue to resolve compared to the Colorado ballot case.  This is a major reason to why many of us believe that SCOTUS is helping Trump delay.\n\nAlso, you haven't answered my question on if you believed that Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson even voted to hear the immunity case and were even in favor of not having the oral arguments until the end of April.",
            "We don't know how the voting went. \n\nMeanwhile, what you think is good scheduling and how the court schedules anything aren't necessarily the same. I'm still mad they haven't taken a couple gun cases where the lower courts are obviously in rebellion against Bruen, still in conference, but I know how this works, so I wait, not claiming any conspiracy.",
            "I know they don't tell us how the justices voted, but if you were guess, how do you believe the liberal justices voted on both whether the immunity case should be heard and when it should be heard.  My guess, based off of some recent clues, is that Justices Sotomayor and Jackson were in opposition, and Justice Kagan either opposed this as well or agreed to hear the immunity case but wanted to have the arguments sooner than late April.\n\nRegarding your example with the gun cases, this doesn't compare to the immunity case.  The Jan. 6 trial is the one thing that would've damaged Trump's campaign big time, but SCOTUS took that away from us.  It's especially upsetting given that Trump has been ahead of Biden in the latest polls, meaning that the Supreme Court basically gave the 2024 election to Trump.  You do realize that if Trump wins, the Jan. 6 case will go away, and not to mention, we'll probably lose our democracy.  Basically, the Supreme Court put our democracy in danger.",
            "You keep wanting it to be over fast so that it will damage Trump. This means your motives are political, and you think anything slower must also be for political reasons, even if it\u2019s not."

            "I think the bigger risk is a Supreme Court that says that (1) laws favoring racial diversity are bad, but those favoring religious diversity are totally fine; (2) laws that allow discrimination based on religion are okay but not based on race; (3) laws that allow more regulations on women\u2019s sexual activities. Remember that there is no explicit constitutional protection for women under the constitution outside the 20th amendment and the equal protection in the 14th. However that clause is open to interpretation and has been expanded over the decades. I could see this Court narrowing it.  Example: limiting the 14th to only US citizens, and thus allowing mass deportations without due process could be a thing. It once was. \n\nAlso, rules regulating free speech could be reduced in some instances (like for example speaking out against government actions or allowing private individuals or the government to sue private organizations for supposed violations of their right to speak freely on quasi-public platforms. Additionally, Thomas and Alito (shocking I know) have been targeting NYT v Sullivan for review for some time; they would love to broaden the definition of libel. \n\nFinally, the government could simply refuse to enforce existing laws; a good example would be labor laws and Civil Rights laws. This is what Reagan did. \n\nSo this is the real issue. The RW hates the New Deal, the Progressive Era and want to return to the Lochner era of jurisprudence where the contract clause reigned supreme and the anti-trust laws were used against unions to stop organizing. Allow massive monopolies and then cut taxes; creating a real feudal system. \n\nThis is what they want.",

            "More likely than I think younger generations then me understand is a real risk. \n\nOne piece of wisdom I've learned is understanding that you can go to bed in one world and wake up to an entirely new world. One event can happen and change the entire paradigm in which we live. The Moon landing, JFK getting killed, computer glitches during the cold war, the Berlin Wall being there then suddenly being ripped down, Apartheid being a way of life then not, the violent partition than later unification of Ireland, 9/11 etc. \n\nYou just go along in life in a world you think you have a grip on then something happens that changes everything. There will still be grocery stores under Trump. Going to work, paying bills etc. All the slaveries we have no won't change (which is the illusion Trump is selling). What *will* happen under Trump is an almost immediate order to deport millions and if some liberal, lgbtq+ or minority actual citizens get caught up in it, eh...we can take it up with international courts because we'll all have the money for that. \n\nWhat comes after that is a systemic dismantling of what we think is right, what we think is legal in order to implement Project 2025 and if you play it through in your head, see the end goal, you'll quickly realize that Trump and his very willing following will institute a modern day American Apartheid with the evangelical white men at the top of the power struggle. Just like in South Africa, there will be police overreach and brutality to the rest of us. The lowest social-standing evangelical white nan (and peripherally white evangelical woman...to a point) will have more social authority than the most accomplished minority, lgbtq+, academic or liberal. Our rights will become less and not always by law but by social \"norms\".\n\nThis is why I got so pissed at that recent interview where Biden pulled the whole \"If I lose I lose as long as I give it my best\" bs as if that's all that's at stake here, his own legacy. We are coming to a massive crossroad in this country and we are apparently stuck with a diminishing human being to stop all this because he won't step aside. That ego is risking everything. \n\nOf course I'll vote for Biden over Trump. I'd vote for a stone but *millions* won't. Polling is showing he's losing Indeoendents after the SotU. His \"redemption\" tour this week has not eased any minds and only spread the concern. Him now saying \"I'm your guy so shut-up and rally\" is going to cost him progressive voters. I know because I'm  one of them (progressive liberal) and I know what him staying in is risking and it's hard to convince younger Gen Z progressives and liberals that this isn't just more of that Boomer attitude that's already cost their generation so much. \n\nI'm convinced if Biden stays in this, Trump wins. Dems, as usual, have done a piss-poor job of messaging. It's scattered and it's been defensive due to Biden's incoherent ramblings and spacing out/looking lost or confused. Dems new message now is \"Stop talking about what all your lying eyes are seeing and support Biden.\"\n\nWere totally fucked and a whole new generation is about to experience going to bed in a world they think they know and waking up to an entirely new reality and that breaks my heart.",
            "That will never happen. If you round up people you have to feed and house them. That costs money. It\u2019s a stupid idea and stupid to even contemplate.\n\nWhile you are all watching for concentration camps what they will be doing is gutting what\u2019s left of the constitution and instituting sharia law with a Christian flavor. We will be brought back to the 1850\u2019s both socially and economically. \n\nInterestingly enough, all you have to do is vote to stop the madness.",

To decisively WIN they would need to take very immediate action. They need to arrest the senior GOP officials and operatives in the Heritage Foundation, purge the Supreme Court, and reestablish rule of law.

            "Three things to point out here.\n\n1. SCOTUS could have chosen not to take up the immunity case at all, especially since the DC Circuit issued a bulletproof opinion which was unanimous.\n\n2. If SCOTUS wanted to hear the immunity case, they could've of taken it up two months earlier when Jack Smith requested that they hear it without it going to the DC Circuit Appeals Court first.\n\n3. The Colorado ballot case was on a faster timeline.  Arguments in that case occurred only a month after they granted cert, and the opinion came out only a month later.  \n\nIn addition, the recent revelations regarding Alito's flags further prove that SCOTUS is helping Trump delay the trial.  But anyway, I hope that you, at least, aren't someone that believes that Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson even voted in Feb. to hear the immunity case and even voted to not have the oral arguments until late April.  This is especially considering the fact that I now believe that at least the former and latter were in opposition.\n\nRegarding Cannon, I definitely agree with you.  As a matter of fact, I knew the case was toast when it was assigned to her given her controversial ruling that got overturned by the 11th Circuit.  I wasn't surprised when Cannon announced she was indefinitely delaying the trial.  The only thing surprising is how 12 Democrats in the Senate voted to confirm Cannon, especially when they confirmed her after the 2020 election.",
            "One, it was a question that needed to be definitively answered, and no case is bulletproof. Also, the 4th Circuit shot down Bianchi v. Frosh per curiam, and then the Supreme Court told them wrong, try that again (GVR). Unanimous means nothing when they're wrong (I think DC was right, but that's irrelevant). \n\nTwo, this was the case that was appealed to them on this issue. The Supreme Court rarely hears cases out of districts, preferring to let them go through circuits first. Smith was asking for something unusual. \n\nThree, different schedules, different argument dates. \n\nAlito's flags prove nothing. \n\nWhat made me think Cannon may be just incompetent was hearing that she made stupid mistakes in other cases too. So I'm sure incompetence is still part of this case, but there's definitely strong evidence for her trying to help Trump too.",
            "I know the Colorado ballot case and immunity cases are two separate issues, but the point I was trying to make was that arguments in Colorado ballot case took place only a month after SCOTUS granted cert. in that case.  Therefore, SCOTUS could've heard arguments for the immunity case in March, but they decided to sit on it until the end of April even though the immunity case is a much easier issue to resolve compared to the Colorado ballot case.  This is a major reason to why many of us believe that SCOTUS is helping Trump delay.\n\nAlso, you haven't answered my question on if you believed that Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson even voted to hear the immunity case and were even in favor of not having the oral arguments until the end of April.",
            "We don't know how the voting went. \n\nMeanwhile, what you think is good scheduling and how the court schedules anything aren't necessarily the same. I'm still mad they haven't taken a couple gun cases where the lower courts are obviously in rebellion against Bruen, still in conference, but I know how this works, so I wait, not claiming any conspiracy.",
            "I know they don't tell us how the justices voted, but if you were guess, how do you believe the liberal justices voted on both whether the immunity case should be heard and when it should be heard.  My guess, based off of some recent clues, is that Justices Sotomayor and Jackson were in opposition, and Justice Kagan either opposed this as well or agreed to hear the immunity case but wanted to have the arguments sooner than late April.\n\nRegarding your example with the gun cases, this doesn't compare to the immunity case.  The Jan. 6 trial is the one thing that would've damaged Trump's campaign big time, but SCOTUS took that away from us.  It's especially upsetting given that Trump has been ahead of Biden in the latest polls, meaning that the Supreme Court basically gave the 2024 election to Trump.  You do realize that if Trump wins, the Jan. 6 case will go away, and not to mention, we'll probably lose our democracy.  Basically, the Supreme Court put our democracy in danger.",
            "You keep wanting it to be over fast so that it will damage Trump. This means your motives are political, and you think anything slower must also be for political reasons, even if it\u2019s not."

As the election approaches, they\u2019ll learn more about Trump and be less inclined to vote for him.\n\nThe Biden campaign will have more funding than the Trump campaign, especially since many Trump donations will go to his legal fees.\n\nDemocrats who are angry about abortion being illegal will be more motivated to vote.\n\nDemocrats have been doing well in other elections.",

Every election, a candidate needs their base AND the independent/moderate/undecided vote.  They can't win with their base alone.\n\n4) Polls are biased or skewed towards those that actually TAKE said polls.  Mostly only older individuals partake in them.  Actually, the fact that Biden keeps even with him should be encouraging by that logic, whether he's above or below.  Trump can't pull out far enough ahead.  And most pollsters put up numbers to make the race APPEAR closer for ratings.\n\n5) Trump's legal woes drain money from him that he COULD'VE used for campaigning.  So he won't get as much airtime and advertising.  He'd be weaker here than either 2016 or 2020.\n\n6) The GOP is making the same mistakes that lost them the 2022 Midterms, doubling down on oppressive religious, racist, or reactionary legislation, which would alienate many minorities and women.\n\n7) Prof. Allan Lichtman, a guy who's correctly predicted elections since 1984 with his \"13 Keys to the White House\" methodology says the 'Keys' favor Biden again this time around.

Remember that there is no explicit constitutional protection for women under the constitution outside the 20th amendment and the equal protection in the 14th. However that clause is open to interpretation and has been expanded over the decades. I could see this Court narrowing it.  Example: limiting the 14th to only US citizens, and thus allowing mass deportations without due process could be a thing. It once was. \n\nAlso, rules regulating free speech could be reduced in some instances (like for example speaking out against government actions or allowing private individuals or the government to sue private organizations for supposed violations of their right to speak freely on quasi-public platforms. Additionally, Thomas and Alito (shocking I know) have been targeting NYT v Sullivan for review for some time; they would love to broaden the definition of libel. \n\nFinally, the government could simply refuse to enforce existing laws; a good example would be labor laws and Civil Rights laws.

            "More likely than I think younger generations then me understand is a real risk. \n\nOne piece of wisdom I've learned is understanding that you can go to bed in one world and wake up to an entirely new world. One event can happen and change the entire paradigm in which we live. The Moon landing, JFK getting killed, computer glitches during the cold war, the Berlin Wall being there then suddenly being ripped down, Apartheid being a way of life then not, the violent partition than later unification of Ireland, 9/11 etc. \n\nYou just go along in life in a world you think you have a grip on then something happens that changes everything. There will still be grocery stores under Trump. Going to work, paying bills etc. All the slaveries we have no won't change (which is the illusion Trump is selling). What *will* happen under Trump is an almost immediate order to deport millions and if some liberal, lgbtq+ or minority actual citizens get caught up in it, eh...we can take it up with international courts because we'll all have the money for that. \n\nWhat comes after that is a systemic dismantling of what we think is right, what we think is legal in order to implement Project 2025 and if you play it through in your head, see the end goal, you'll quickly realize that Trump and his very willing following will institute a modern day American Apartheid with the evangelical white men at the top of the power struggle. Just like in South Africa, there will be police overreach and brutality to the rest of us. The lowest social-standing evangelical white nan (and peripherally white evangelical woman...to a point) will have more social authority than the most accomplished minority, lgbtq+, academic or liberal. Our rights will become less and not always by law but by social \"norms\".\n\nThis is why I got so pissed at that recent interview where Biden pulled the whole \"If I lose I lose as long as I give it my best\" bs as if that's all that's at stake here, his own legacy. We are coming to a massive crossroad in this country and we are apparently stuck with a diminishing human being to stop all this because he won't step aside. That ego is risking everything. \n\nOf course I'll vote for Biden over Trump. I'd vote for a stone but *millions* won't. Polling is showing he's losing Indeoendents after the SotU. His \"redemption\" tour this week has not eased any minds and only spread the concern. Him now saying \"I'm your guy so shut-up and rally\" is going to cost him progressive voters. I know because I'm  one of them (progressive liberal) and I know what him staying in is risking and it's hard to convince younger Gen Z progressives and liberals that this isn't just more of that Boomer attitude that's already cost their generation so much. \n\nI'm convinced if Biden stays in this, Trump wins. Dems, as usual, have done a piss-poor job of messaging. It's scattered and it's been defensive due to Biden's incoherent ramblings and spacing out/looking lost or confused. Dems new message now is \"Stop talking about what all your lying eyes are seeing and support Biden.\"\n\nWere totally fucked and a whole new generation is about to experience going to bed in a world they think they know and waking up to an entirely new reality and that breaks my heart.",

IDK exactly how they're averaging the polls or how far back they include - but there's a very good chance this includes at least some pre-conviction polls.\n\nSecond, even with current polls it's going to take a while to figure out the effect his conviction has. And, honestly, we'll probably never be able to parse it out fully.  Right now the polls we have from immediately after the conviction indicate a 1.5(ish) gain by Biden. But that could easily partially or fully revert. There also could be secondary effects - such as a cumulative tarnishing of Trump's image. This could have a low immediate impact but be great fodder for future attack ads. Or it could be a blip that people forget about in two weeks. \n\nThird, while polling is the best data we've got in predicting the election outcome it tells only half the story. The biggest unknown variables are enthusiasm and engagement. Polling is pretty weak at measuring that. Even if the polls didn't budge at all you could still see the conviction drive down center-right turnout and drive up anti-Trump participation. \n\nThe election is almost certainly going to be close. Don't expect any dramatic shifts. If a gap opens up at all it will probably appear slowly - and probably not until the conventions both wrap up.\n\nJust stay engaged and keep doing all you can to help defeat Trump.

He was interviewing some College Democrat organizations throughout the country, and discussing with them the I-P issue, student loans, enthusiasm, etc.  After the interview, I was shocked by three things: First, the I-P issue is a much bigger deal than people want to admit; Second, the College Democrat organizations are not only upset with Biden, many of them seem opposed to him and want him to lose; and Third, the White House and its Reelection campaign seem completely clueless and have no plan whatsoever to do anything about it except hoping that the polls are wrong or telling people I told you so after they lose. It is honestly embarrassing and I think it is one of the reasons many people like myself have not given money this year.  \n\nEvery time they call or send me an email for money, I ask, \"what is the strategy?\" Response: crickets.

            "Three things to point out here.\n\n1. SCOTUS could have chosen not to take up the immunity case at all, especially since the DC Circuit issued a bulletproof opinion which was unanimous.\n\n2. If SCOTUS wanted to hear the immunity case, they could've of taken it up two months earlier when Jack Smith requested that they hear it without it going to the DC Circuit Appeals Court first.\n\n3. The Colorado ballot case was on a faster timeline.  Arguments in that case occurred only a month after they granted cert, and the opinion came out only a month later.  \n\nIn addition, the recent revelations regarding Alito's flags further prove that SCOTUS is helping Trump delay the trial.  But anyway, I hope that you, at least, aren't someone that believes that Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson even voted in Feb. to hear the immunity case and even voted to not have the oral arguments until late April.  This is especially considering the fact that I now believe that at least the former and latter were in opposition.\n\nRegarding Cannon, I definitely agree with you.  As a matter of fact, I knew the case was toast when it was assigned to her given her controversial ruling that got overturned by the 11th Circuit.  I wasn't surprised when Cannon announced she was indefinitely delaying the trial.  The only thing surprising is how 12 Democrats in the Senate voted to confirm Cannon, especially when they confirmed her after the 2020 election.",
            "One, it was a question that needed to be definitively answered, and no case is bulletproof. Also, the 4th Circuit shot down Bianchi v. Frosh per curiam, and then the Supreme Court told them wrong, try that again (GVR). Unanimous means nothing when they're wrong (I think DC was right, but that's irrelevant). \n\nTwo, this was the case that was appealed to them on this issue. The Supreme Court rarely hears cases out of districts, preferring to let them go through circuits first. Smith was asking for something unusual. \n\nThree, different schedules, different argument dates. \n\nAlito's flags prove nothing. \n\nWhat made me think Cannon may be just incompetent was hearing that she made stupid mistakes in other cases too. So I'm sure incompetence is still part of this case, but there's definitely strong evidence for her trying to help Trump too.",
            "I know the Colorado ballot case and immunity cases are two separate issues, but the point I was trying to make was that arguments in Colorado ballot case took place only a month after SCOTUS granted cert. in that case.  Therefore, SCOTUS could've heard arguments for the immunity case in March, but they decided to sit on it until the end of April even though the immunity case is a much easier issue to resolve compared to the Colorado ballot case.  This is a major reason to why many of us believe that SCOTUS is helping Trump delay.\n\nAlso, you haven't answered my question on if you believed that Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson even voted to hear the immunity case and were even in favor of not having the oral arguments until the end of April.",
            "We don't know how the voting went. \n\nMeanwhile, what you think is good scheduling and how the court schedules anything aren't necessarily the same. I'm still mad they haven't taken a couple gun cases where the lower courts are obviously in rebellion against Bruen, still in conference, but I know how this works, so I wait, not claiming any conspiracy.",
            "I know they don't tell us how the justices voted, but if you were guess, how do you believe the liberal justices voted on both whether the immunity case should be heard and when it should be heard.  My guess, based off of some recent clues, is that Justices Sotomayor and Jackson were in opposition, and Justice Kagan either opposed this as well or agreed to hear the immunity case but wanted to have the arguments sooner than late April.\n\nRegarding your example with the gun cases, this doesn't compare to the immunity case.  The Jan. 6 trial is the one thing that would've damaged Trump's campaign big time, but SCOTUS took that away from us.  It's especially upsetting given that Trump has been ahead of Biden in the latest polls, meaning that the Supreme Court basically gave the 2024 election to Trump.  You do realize that if Trump wins, the Jan. 6 case will go away, and not to mention, we'll probably lose our democracy.  Basically, the Supreme Court put our democracy in danger.",

Nevermind that this poll is so far removed from believability that it has Trump winning Nevada by a laugh out loud impossible thirteen points. And nevermind that the other recent polls have Biden winning. This one poll, which is obviously wrong on its face, is getting endless media attention.\n\nThis is when you have to take a breath and remind yourself that the political journalism industry is the dirtiest, filthiest, slimiest, most dishonest thing you\u2019ve ever encountered in your life. The political journalism industry exists solely to turn a profit, which is accomplished by ratings and page views. This industry does not exist for any other reason.\n\nThe polls have their problems. In fact the polls have a lot of problems. The polls aren\u2019t the problem. The problem is that the (entire) media is flat out lying to you about what the polls are even saying. When most polls have Biden winning, and one poll has Trump winning, but the media only talks about that one poll while pretending the others don\u2019t exist, the media is LYING TO YOU.\u201d \u2014 Bill Palmer",

Not just FoxNews, Newsmax, or ONAN.\n\nPeople are believing that crime rates are rising (they're not), and that inflation is Biden's fault (it's not).  That's because their newsmedia personalities are telling them so. They lie with impunity, because there's no law in this country making it illegal (or prosecutable).

Biden, unfortunately, is simply not that guy.  This is a moment for Obama, Clinton or JFK, and what we have is LBJ. LBJ was great at getting excellent domestic policies through Congress; however, he failed miserably at persuading his own party, let alone the general American public, about why were in Vietnam and what its importance was. He just sort of expected the people to trust him because he was POTUS. Biden is giving off the same vibe. Biden should know better; he was around when Nixon was POTUS and Watergate happened.

Every election, a candidate needs their base AND the independent/moderate/undecided vote.  They can't win with their base alone.\n\n4) Polls are biased or skewed towards those that actually TAKE said polls.  Mostly only older individuals partake in them.  Actually, the fact that Biden keeps even with him should be encouraging by that logic, whether he's above or below.  Trump can't pull out far enough ahead.  And most pollsters put up numbers to make the race APPEAR closer for ratings.\n\n5) Trump's legal woes drain money from him that he COULD'VE used for campaigning.  So he won't get as much airtime and advertising.  He'd be weaker here than either 2016 or 2020.\n\n6) The GOP is making the same mistakes that lost them the 2022 Midterms, doubling down on oppressive religious, racist, or reactionary legislation, which would alienate many minorities and women.\n\n7) Prof. Allan Lichtman, a guy who's correctly predicted elections since 1984 with his \"13 Keys to the White House\" methodology says the 'Keys' favor Biden again this time around.

We have always been against deficit spending, we have always opposed foreign aid (yes, even Israel), we have always opposed the death penalty. We have always been free market capitalists (this includes labor markets).\n\nIt's not our fault you never looked deeper than the surface.\n\n[It's literally this meme. I know you're a conservative so let me make this abundantly clear: **WE ARE NOT FRIENDS.**](https://i.redd.it/e9na24n7kz2d1.jpeg)",
            "Unlike other commenters, I don't have a huge issue with the \"more sensical conservatives\" view, although I do agree that's an oversimplification.\n\nI would consider things like accepting atypical lifestyles (esp. the LGBTQ community) as more sensible than most conservatives. We agree with conservatives on not giving special treatment to groups like that, but many conservatives want to give them lesser treatment than others, and that's where we differ. That was the final straw issue for me to ditch the GOP, instead of focusing on whether same sex marriage should be legal libertarians question why the government is defining marriage at all. We're also more consistent than them on economic issues where we agree with them, like government spending.\n\nI also consider us more sensible liberals in many ways. We agree with what they claim to believe on individual rights like privacy and free speech, but we're consistent on it. If the left was consistent, Snowden would be free. Same with being anti-war, we oppose all wars of aggression not just the ones our political opponents start.\n\nAs for what happened. I don't think we've strayed as far as you perceive, but in the US at least the Libertarian Party has changed. Ironically, I see it as going more to the right, with an influx of right leaning libertarians who have given up on the GOP because of idiots like Trump. And I think Chase getting the nomination is a hard swing against that trend by those of us who have been around for a while. Ideologically speaking, I think most of the people seeking our nomination were very similar, abortion and immigration were the only major differences and the party is genuinely split on those issues. But Chase appealed to those of us who worry that the party feels too much like \"Republicans who don't like Trump.\" He still agrees with the overwhelming majority of libertarians on the overwhelming majority of issues, like everyone who sought the nomination, he just happens to talk more about the culture war aspects and swings a bit left of average for us on some of that.\n\nAnd to address your point about that trial being politically motivated. I agree, I don't think Trump would've been charged if it weren't for his views. That said, if falsifying those business records lead to any shareholders, investors or other people he was in business with being defrauded, then I agree it should be prosecuted. In my mind, this case being politically motivated is the smaller issue, so many other cases not being investigated is the issue. They're too busy going after victimless crimes like the drug war and peaceful gun ownership to look at economic fraud.",

Owning property has long been a big part of individual financial freedom and independence. Owning, rather than renting, is also a more sound financial option, for reasons I really shouldn't have to explain.

            "Congratulations! You have fallen for one of the 5 top uni-party fringe scams intent on rage trolling citizens and distract them from real issues:\n\n1. Abortion (Congress has had 60 years to pass any law on this, but chose not to...ever)\n2. Immigration (Congress has failed to pass substantial legal definition and reform for over 160 years, because this is their side step to the 13-15th amendments; It is literally the new slavery)\n3. Alliances with perceived enemies (You don;t spend money to take on enemies when there are no enemies)\n4. Entitlements (Social Security, for example, which is mislabels and mishandled)\n5. Small impact programs (Pork spending by line-item, student loans, welfare for drug users, etc. which have minuscule impacts to the population, but drive massive industry such as the 273% inflation on college tuition since 1990, or the massive waste of a \"War on Drugs\")\n\nThese items distract you from the fact that the Legislative and Executive branches have far exceeded their Constitutional authority. They distract you from the unproclaimed and endless wars we have entangled ourselves in. These bright, shiny objects pull your focus away from elected officials with $174,000 annual salaries, who somehow are all millionaires and guessing the markets at exactly the right timing to buy and sell *every damned time.* Elected officials with massive donor war chests capable of buying elections outright which they funnel directly to buy mainstream media sources in the biggest ad buy every 2-4 years.\n\nThe Russians are not our enemies. The Ukrainians are not our friends. The leaders of these nations and our own have figured out a perfect scheme to take from their citizenry massive piles of money to enrich their corporate friends, and to get profit and kickback. We get the bill. And every moment we waste arguing \"Are the R's traitors, or are the D's\", they win.",
            "In the u.s. right now if you are supporting increased military spending you have to choose to point that military at something. Dems choose Russia Republicans choose China. Some choose both. \n\nA: Biden has no ties with Russia that I've ever heard of. He has connections via Hunter to Ukraine of course and China. (Classic influence peddling) \n\nB: Trump has as many connections to Russia as any other international business man. (He invested in some buildings there) The right wing populist position on Russia has basically been: \"why are we fighting these guys?\" Russia is a socially conservative country that has participated in counterterrorism and (before recent events) had no inclination to take direct action against the west. This is part of the populist pivot to anti-china rhetoric. \n\nWhich is most accurate? Hard to say as the Trump Russia collusion claims were completely divorced from reality and widely claimed. Claiming Biden has ties to Russia is 5% more divorced from reality but I've never heard anyone say it.",

            "Both are accurate.  Both D's and R's are seditious foreign actors of a private translational fascist cartel that is setting up new aristocracy. Over decades, using its growing consolidation of media and politics, they installed loyal DnRs that formed a sleeper cell they activated for Covid.  They did the same for all supply chains, like media, and all stepped out true Nazi Blitzcrieg style.  It's an impressive long game, TBH.  For them, survival of the fittest makes exploitation a moral imperative.\n\nThe Crisis theatre decade of 2020-2030 is orchestrated. Covid, Ukraine, Hamas, etc etc are all staged. The aid bills are proxy appropriations bills for the cartel- this is how they fund themselves.  The cartel is allied with China- it's where they engineered covid, and where they are loading all the chemicals in products that are sickening and sterilizing the west.  The most fascinating thing to me is who's in charge- western fascist or China?  Are they friends or is one exploiting the other?\n\nSince the cartel owns your information and truth, and has AI to simulate speech and thought, truth is gone.  Even some of the potentially genuine holders of western liberty, like Rand Paul, have gone to the dark side.  They don't really have a choice, since if you are an influencer and don't support it, you are disappeared from the media and are out.  I predict we'll see Julian Assange remerge as a false voice of dissent, since, well, it's that or hell never see light again.",

Previously, this discount window was public and it was frowned upon for using it.

            "Here is what ChatGPT had to say about the way billionaires don\u2019t have to sell their stock to get money and avoid paying taxes in the process:\n\nYes, using loans against their stock holdings is one method that wealthy individuals use to minimize taxes. This strategy allows them to access liquidity without triggering taxable events. Here\u2019s how it works in more detail:\n\n1. **Avoiding Capital Gains Tax**: By taking out loans against their stock portfolios, wealthy individuals avoid selling their stocks and thus defer or avoid capital gains tax. Capital gains tax is only incurred when the stock is sold and a profit is realized. By not selling the stock, they defer the tax liability indefinitely.\n\n2. **Access to Liquidity**: Wealthy individuals can borrow significant amounts of money using their stock as collateral. This provides them with cash for investments, purchases, or other needs without selling their assets.\n\n3. **Low-Interest Rates**: Wealthy individuals often receive loans at favorable interest rates due to the low risk for lenders. These loans are secured by valuable stock portfolios, making them relatively safe for banks to offer at lower rates.\n\n4. **Interest Deductions**: In some cases, the interest paid on these loans can be tax-deductible, particularly if the loan is used for investment purposes. This can further reduce the effective cost of borrowing.\n\n5. **Maintaining Ownership**: By not selling their stocks, wealthy individuals retain ownership and control over their investments. This allows them to benefit from any appreciation in the stock\u2019s value without triggering a taxable event.\n\n6. **Step-Up in Basis**: When stocks are passed on to heirs, the cost basis of the stock is \"stepped up\" to the current market value at the time of the owner's death. This can significantly reduce the capital gains tax liability for the heirs if they sell the inherited stock.\n\nWhile this strategy is legal and commonly used, it highlights broader issues in the tax system related to wealth inequality and the ability of the wealthy to defer taxes indefinitely. It\u2019s one of the reasons why there is ongoing debate about tax reform and the ways to address these disparities.",

And that\u2019s how you measure the stake an individual has in the USA and how much they should pay in taxes.    \nAnd you only do it for net worths above like $10M so 99% of Americans don\u2019t even have to worry.",

It\u2019s just an indicator of your higher wealth. You pay more tax because you own a bigger chunk of the town.  \nZoom out to a federal level and include ownership of businesses (stock) as well as other assets like property, and the same concept applies. A billionaire would pay more tax because he owns a bigger chunk of the country.  \nAnd I agree the fluctuating value of capital assets gets messy and might really screw over someone with a small brokerage account/401K. But that\u2019s why we\u2019d only do this for assets over what one might consider \u201cfuck you money\u201d.  \n\u201cOh man, I had to pay 0.5% tax on my $90M portfolio last year.

That has only gone up 3% per year ($30-ish) since then, regardless of home valuation. A high-earner buys that house for $800K today because it\u2019s a hot gentrifying neighborhood.

The reason Elon got to keep doing this was because of using government contracts as a hedge to drive investment. That combined with tons of tax incentives means we indirectly paid for his company to blow up rockets until some of em actually worked out. spacex is definitely the least offensive of his companies but it\u2019s still subsidized by our taxes and not all that brilliant\u2026"

In such a situation, it'd probably have to be proven that there would be a materially measurable premium associated with said shortage (such as established quotes of expedited orders). And, depending on the situation, a publicly traded company voluntarily delaying the rights of purchase to another company without an exchange of capital - especially involving a CEO who has knowledge of order fulfillment time & potentially expedited costs who is acting in capacity of both legal entities by both signing off on the surrendering and authorization of permission to fulfillment rights - may have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of both entities. \n\nIt really depends on the facts of the scenario. For instance, was Tesla reimbursed? Further, does this article alone provide enough information to conclude the *full details* of such an exchange? I didn't see enough facts to conclude whether this was out of the goodness of Tesla's heart or if there was potentially a premium. Regardless,  CNBC's 12,000 chip figure have a *retail price* of 30,000 each (but of course that doesn't mean each chip is valued 30,000 as it costs money to sell things). Regardless, that's fair market value of an item that has a shortage and those rights are potential future revenue that has already been established is something that another company demands. So if I were a Telsa shareholder, I'd probably want a little more details on further information on this exchange, to know if Tesla benefited in any way from exchanging the right (perhaps price drops), to know whether Tesla made any revenue off of this exchange, if they did not be given enough information to understand why, and to know figures the opportunity cost of losing said shipments.",

Here are the key points of the book:\n\n1. **Menticide and Individual Submission**: Meerloo discusses how psychological manipulation can lead to the destruction of individual free will, transforming people into passive followers. Techniques include isolation, reward and punishment, and the use of fear and propaganda to control and condition individuals.\n\n2. **Mass Brainwashing**: The book explores how mass brainwashing is achieved through techniques such as repetition, the use of media, and the creation of a culture of fear and conformity. Institutions and media play a significant role in molding public opinion and suppressing dissent.\n\n3. **Technology's Role in Indoctrination**: Meerloo highlights the role of technology (like television and radio during his time) in facilitating indoctrination and mass manipulation, making individuals more susceptible to control by overloading their senses and reducing opportunities for critical thinking.\n\n4. **Weaponization of Fear**: Fear is a central tool for totalitarian regimes to maintain control. Techniques include surveillance, propaganda, and creating a climate of fear and suspicion among the populace, which discourages resistance and promotes compliance.\n\n5. **Resistance and Resilience**: The final sections of the book discuss ways individuals and societies can resist authoritarian tactics. Meerloo emphasizes the importance of education, critical thinking, and fostering a culture of open dialogue and diversity to build resilience against totalitarian influences.\n\nMeerloo draws on examples from Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and his personal experiences, providing insights into the psychological impact of totalitarian practices and offering strategies for safeguarding mental freedom and democratic values.",

            "Here is what ChatGPT had to say about the way billionaires don\u2019t have to sell their stock to get money and avoid paying taxes in the process:\n\nYes, using loans against their stock holdings is one method that wealthy individuals use to minimize taxes. This strategy allows them to access liquidity without triggering taxable events. Here\u2019s how it works in more detail:\n\n1. **Avoiding Capital Gains Tax**: By taking out loans against their stock portfolios, wealthy individuals avoid selling their stocks and thus defer or avoid capital gains tax. Capital gains tax is only incurred when the stock is sold and a profit is realized. By not selling the stock, they defer the tax liability indefinitely.\n\n2. **Access to Liquidity**: Wealthy individuals can borrow significant amounts of money using their stock as collateral. This provides them with cash for investments, purchases, or other needs without selling their assets.\n\n3. **Low-Interest Rates**: Wealthy individuals often receive loans at favorable interest rates due to the low risk for lenders. These loans are secured by valuable stock portfolios, making them relatively safe for banks to offer at lower rates.\n\n4. **Interest Deductions**: In some cases, the interest paid on these loans can be tax-deductible, particularly if the loan is used for investment purposes. This can further reduce the effective cost of borrowing.\n\n5. **Maintaining Ownership**: By not selling their stocks, wealthy individuals retain ownership and control over their investments. This allows them to benefit from any appreciation in the stock\u2019s value without triggering a taxable event.\n\n6. **Step-Up in Basis**: When stocks are passed on to heirs, the cost basis of the stock is \"stepped up\" to the current market value at the time of the owner's death. This can significantly reduce the capital gains tax liability for the heirs if they sell the inherited stock.\n\nWhile this strategy is legal and commonly used, it highlights broader issues in the tax system related to wealth inequality and the ability of the wealthy to defer taxes indefinitely. It\u2019s one of the reasons why there is ongoing debate about tax reform and the ways to address these disparities.",

Falcon Heavy doesn't launch often but it has put up two classified missions, a NASA mission (Psyche) and is slated to fly Europa Clipper this year (hopefully).

The last time that happened we ended up with the challenger situation and lost good lives. There are too many yes men when it comes to musk and I only stated barely functioning because they have had a lot of successful launches but the scope and goals of those launches have not always been met. This all comes while more and more companies/countries are getting involved in space around the world and the world itself is going through vast environmental changes. For all we know these rockets are fine now but what happens when the average temp around the globe sees dramatic raises or drops that can't/aren't being accounted for now thanks to misinformation and deniability. \n\nI don't have bad feeling towards spacex and it's engineers/scientists especially since they are working with NASA but I grown concerned with musks involvement and what he tries to push through in the name of innovation.",

This is not something NASA can do because after a couple failed launches they\u2019d simply get their funding cut. The reason Elon got to keep doing this was because of using government contracts as a hedge to drive investment. That combined with tons of tax incentives means we indirectly paid for his company to blow up rockets until some of em actually worked out. spacex is definitely the least offensive of his companies but it\u2019s still subsidized by our taxes and not all that brilliant\u2026"

            "In situations regarding rights to inventory, I could see it argued that the principles of supply and demand and free market economics suggest that, during a shortage, there may be a reasonably measurable value associated with the rights to these GPUs. In such a situation, it'd probably have to be proven that there would be a materially measurable premium associated with said shortage (such as established quotes of expedited orders). And, depending on the situation, a publicly traded company voluntarily delaying the rights of purchase to another company without an exchange of capital - especially involving a CEO who has knowledge of order fulfillment time & potentially expedited costs who is acting in capacity of both legal entities by both signing off on the surrendering and authorization of permission to fulfillment rights - may have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of both entities. \n\nIt really depends on the facts of the scenario. For instance, was Tesla reimbursed? Further, does this article alone provide enough information to conclude the *full details* of such an exchange? I didn't see enough facts to conclude whether this was out of the goodness of Tesla's heart or if there was potentially a premium. Regardless,  CNBC's 12,000 chip figure have a *retail price* of 30,000 each (but of course that doesn't mean each chip is valued 30,000 as it costs money to sell things). Regardless, that's fair market value of an item that has a shortage and those rights are potential future revenue that has already been established is something that another company demands. So if I were a Telsa shareholder, I'd probably want a little more details on further information on this exchange, to know if Tesla benefited in any way from exchanging the right (perhaps price drops), to know whether Tesla made any revenue off of this exchange, if they did not be given enough information to understand why, and to know figures the opportunity cost of losing said shipments.",

There are some people who vote for Trump because they think he will! But actually, I think he'll do what he did last time: appoint more arch-conservative judges -- who will be there for many years after him -- while posting on Truth Social and eating hamburgers and derailing policy meetings with his advisors by going on 45-minute tangents about hot babes on private planes.\n\nThat just isn't Nazi Germany, which I do think really tried to mobilize Germans and create the sense that they were living in a \"great age.\" In MAGA, I see a nihilistic and atomized society run by people who seek to fuel mutual distrust and deep indifference. The idea is to make people passive, not mass mobilization like in a totalitarian regime. The only thing that matters is making money and avoiding how to be ripped off by other people.\u00a0The actual result is cynicism, fatalism, and apathy. A bit like Putin's Russia.\n\nBut it's for this reason they need some \"excess\" to make it \"work.\" They have to dress themselves up to create the image that what they're doing is some great drama.

The dog whistle has been there for decades, but now it's becoming louder to the humans.\n\n>Do you think there is a genuine old school 1930s-era fascist threat from Trump and his associates?\n\nI think that's the wrong framing. The thing about fascism is that it's ideologically slippery and forms to fit into whatever the current context is. I don't, for example, think that Donald Trump is going to lean into eugenics, which was a much more popular pseudoscience in the 30s, talk about purifying the white race ([though there are plenty in his orbit who do talk like that](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gop-leaders-denounce-greene-gosar-speaking-white-nationalist-event-rcna18050)), and start a bunch of death camps.\n\nWhat we do know is that Trump taps into a lot of popular outrage and has a very authoritarian bent. He cares not for norms and laws, except how they might be exploited for his own power. We've had 4 years of him being in office to see that explicitly, as well as the last 3 1/2 years of him continuing to use bad faith rhetoric and actions to exploit the systems trying to hold him accountable for his laundry list of wrongdoing, both in and out of office. At the very least, the attempted self-coup to subvert the 2020 election and remain in office demonstrate a minimum threshold for how far Donald Trump is willing to go to arrogate power to himself at the expense of the Republic which he seeks office under. For that reason alone, the prospect of a second Trump presidency should be incredibly concerning for anyone who cares about the continued stability and legitimacy of the United States.\n\nBeyond the doomsday scenario of a President-made-King (which does echo what Hitler and Mussolini did in the 1930s, when they leveraged parliamentary office into becoming dictators with indefinite tenure), what might a 2025 Trump Administration look like? For a start, we can expect him to continue along the same paths that he went down starting in 2017. We can expect the Federal government to corruptly hand out key administration posts to captains of industry with the intent to deregulate those industries for private profit. Expect the EPA to cast a blind eye to polluters. Expect a rollback of greenhouse gas controls. As an extension to that, expect foreign affairs to once again be an out-and-out exercise in wielding diplomatic power for private profit and personal gain. We saw Trump try to leverage Ukraine's relationship with the US to neuter a political opponent, which led to his first impeachment, as an example.\n\nExpect a second-term Trump to continue trying to subvert the professional civil service to bend it to his political and personal will. We saw the first attempts at that late in his first term with the attempted implementation of Schedule F, which would have turned any career employee who has any say in Federal policy turned into an at-will excepted service employee subject to the President's dismissal without due process. Rather than a civil service dedicated to the Republic and executing the rule of law (*all* laws, not just the President's orders) and the nuanced technicalities of the field they administer, you'll have an army of bureaucrats responsive to the President and the President alone.\n\nWe saw cruelty and theatrics at the border in Trump's first term, and I would expect more of the same, perhaps ramped up. Expect a slowdown or complete halting of processing of asylum and humanitarian claims, especially if they come from less wealthy or less white countries of origin, just like when Trump instituted the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy and canceled a Federal program allowing refugees from Haiti to continue remaining in the US. Expect a reinstitution of the \"zero tolerance\" illegal border crossing policy that resulted in screaming children being ripped from their mother's arms simply because the mother committed a misdemeanor criminal offense. Expect those children to be abused by a careless bureaucracy, including being kept in inhumane detention facilities. Expect a not insignificant number of those children to be repatriated back to a dangerous country in a dangerous situation, or alternatively to be fostered in the US without care given to whether they are being placed with a safe family who will care for them. Expect those children to be lost to their families forever, either through trafficking, abuse, or lost records. Going a step beyond what Trump I did, expect Trump II to build camps (perhaps rephrased to a more placid sounding \"emergency detention facilities\" or some such term) for any and all suspected or confirmed illegal aliens. Expect lawful asylum seekers who do make it through the border to be sent to these camps, rather than released on their own recognizance while waiting for an immigration hearing. Expect ICE to be involved, but also expect state and local law enforcement to be deputized by ICE and given free rein to detain anyone within their jurisdictions that they suspect to be in the United States unlawfully. Expect those detainees to be given no legal recourse, even if their suspected immigration status was in error. Expect the conditions in those facilities to be inhumane, and expect them to be built with emergency funds on corrupt contracts funneled to Trump's boosters and family.\n\nI live in Portland and saw firsthand the Trump administration's response to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. Over the wishes both the state and the city, Trump sent various DHS units to Portland to \"protect the Federal courthouse and other Federal offices in downtown Portland.\" These officers in unmarked cars and displaying no markings identifying them as law enforcement abducted isolated citizens not engaged in any criminal conduct or imminently threatening Federal facilities off the streets. We're lucky that no one was shot on either end of those interactions. We also saw heavy-handed Federal police tactics in other cities and at other times, such as when Trump cleared Lafayette Square so that he could have a photo opp (hint: the point of the activity was not the photo, it was the demonstration of power against liberal protestors for his base of supporters). In 2025, I expect to see mass protests all over the country if Trump is inaugurated, and I expect Trump escalate his previous tactics to quickly invoke the Insurrection Act, quickly deploy available military units, including the National Guard, and impose some kind of martial law and occupation on \"lawless Democratic cities.\" I hesitate to speculate on what happens after that, but I can't imagine anything good.\n\nThose are just the things off the top of my head. Does that resemble in 1930s fascism? In some ways, sure, but not in other ways. Are we going to have roaming bands of brownshirts and blackshirts? Probably not (though I imagine the Proud Boys and Oathkeepers might make some noise in isolated cases). Will we see concentration camps to detain and segregate \"others?\" I would bet on it, especially in the immigration realm. Will we see a more authoritarian Federal government, with various liberal institutions being eroded or outright dismantled? That's a 100% guarantee.\n\nFinally, I'd like to point out that the Heritage Foundation has put together a combination wish list, road map, and detailed plan for imposing a conservative policy agenda on the country, called [Project 2025](https://www.project2025.org/) ([associated Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025#Policies)). While the Heritage Foundation has been publishing these \"Mandates for Leadership\" for 40 years, Project 2025 stands out for its ambition and desire to entirely overhaul effectively every part of the Federal Government. It was heavily influenced by the lessons learned in the first Trump administration and, while written in a way that was technically generic, has a second Trump term, or at least a Trump-like term, specifically in mind. A President Trump would by no means be *required* to hew to what's in Project 2025, I expect there to be relatively little deviation from it. Go ahead and skim through it. If you're not a fan of fascism in general, it should scare the bejeezus out of you.",
            "Yesterday I misunderstood the source of that 'unified reich' text that appeared in the video. I assumed it was an article from somewhere (which really would be just as bad but I digress) that the employee copied and pasted into the video without really paying attention.\n\nBut nope! Someone hired by the trump team was given specific instructions on making a video, and what they did to follow the instructions was to generate it from scratch, to type the words \"unified reich\" and to make it look like a headline and compose the image to look like a newspaper. \n\nWhatever their instructions were these words were absolutely used intentionally.",
            "when Trump was elected in 2016, I thought that some of his wording, behavior, etc. seemed pretty clearly textbook  statist would-be violent ruler.\n\nIn 2020 what I told my Jewish family and friends was that we didn't have that many jobs coming out of Hebrew School, but that \"not voting for the next Hitler\" and speaking out against him was pretty clearly one of them, and that  those who vote for Trump did not apparently take that \"never again\" stuff very seriously.  The one thing I was grateful for was that Trump made his Constitution-wrecking intentions pretty obvious from the start (in my opinion).  \n\n[edited]\nI was always worried that if the moment of truth came for me as a voter, where I had to stand up against a threat to the Rule of Law, I would not be entirely sure whom to oppose and whom to support.  But in the case of the 2016, 2020 and 2024 elections, the matter is quite clear to me.  As uncomfortable as I may be with Biden's garden variety socialism, in my view one must vote for Biden as a stop-gap against Trump and his fascist goals.  If Trump is re-elected, or if he succeeds in his plan to not heed the vote, then the Constitution as we know it is over.  Trump has made that crystal clear.  If my fellow Americans who are Republicans and subscribe to Republican values and platform positions wanted me to consider voting for the Republican, then they should have nominated someone who is not transparently seeking the end of the Rule of Law.\n\n  \nA book that has helped me through all of this is called \"The Ominous Parallels\".    It was published in the early 80s by an associate of Ayn Rand named Leonard Peikoff and (whether you like her philosophy or dislike it) does an eerily excellent job of laying out pre-WWII Germany, 1970s US, and the parallels between the two.  This is the book that did the most to help me recognize the language of right-wing statism coming out of Trump's mouth, and (critically) out of the mouths of his supporters in the media.  I wonder if Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Beck et. al. understand the extent of their contributions to Mr. Trump's efforts to undermine the rule of Law.   Ironically the author of the Ominous Parallels himself tragically voiced support for voting for Trump in 2020.  It's not as though he didn't warn us in his book that in a situation where there is plenty of intellectual bankruptcy to go around, particularly bankruptcy in our most fundamental philosophic thinking, that a dictator could arise and come to power.  It has made some sense to me that otherwise rational highly intelligent people would seem to shock us by falling into the trap of allowing Biden to be so demonized that they will vote for anyone against him, but I can't help but say it is terribly disappointing that this happened to Peikoff.",

That will be announced in 2 weeks after the jury results of the NYC trial are announced.   Nikki is first required to denounce the judge and prosecutor in the case that results in his guilty verdict.\n\nTrump took advantage of Haley, since he knew she is so ambitious that she would sell her soul to be VP, even after Trump insulted her, her husband, her family, and her voters.

Why argue about specific issues at the point of a gun, or when the rule of law is being threatened?    \n  \nTrump seems to be completely committed to destroying the US voting system (naturally under guise of being concerned about the \"fairness\" of the vote).  Why argue about whom to vote for if one of the candidates is so clearly committed to not respecting the vote outcome, and to undermining the voting system itself?  \n\nIf Republicans wanted me to consider voting for their candidate, they should have nominated someone who would respect basic legal principles.\n\n2.  Another thing I've noticed all these years, which is probably also taken from the would-be fascist dictator playbook, is the extraordinary vilification of Trump's opponents.  Both Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden have received this treatment.  As long as they can be made out to be so evil that nobody should vote for them, then Trump can be the recipient of more votes.  Yet Biden in particular has not shown the disrespect for the rule of law that Trump has.  Thus, I can consider voting for him, much as I may dislike some of his stances on the issues.",

            "**Title: Exploring Parallels: Trump, Project 2025, and Historical Comparisons**\n\n**Introduction:**\nIn contemporary political discourse, comparisons between historical events and present-day movements often prompt intense debates. One such comparison gaining attention is the perceived resemblance between Trump's administration, Project 2025, and the Republican Party with elements of Hitler's Nazi Party. This analysis aims to delve into these comparisons objectively, examining ideologies, policies, and societal impacts to evaluate their validity and implications for the future.\n\n**Consolidation of Power:**\n*Historical Context:*\nThe failed Beer Hall Putsch and Hitler's subsequent rise to Chancellorship in Germany are notable historical events showcasing power consolidation by the Nazi Party.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nDrawing parallels, Project 2025, initiated by The Heritage Foundation, aims to establish a comprehensive conservative agenda. Comparisons have been made between Trump's leadership style and Hitler's consolidation of power, raising concerns about civil rights protections and government restructuring.\n\n**Civil Rights and Contraception Ban:**\n*Historical Context:*\nUnder Hitler, strict gender roles and contraception bans were enforced, reflecting authoritarian control over societal norms.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nSimilarly, Project 2025 proposes control over body autonomy and contraception, emphasizing traditional family dynamics and religious ideologies, raising concerns about gender equality and discrimination protections.\n\n**Religious Nationalism:**\n*Historical Context:*\nHitler's use of Christianity to justify extremist views and policies is a historical precedent showcasing religious nationalism in politics.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nProject 2025 advocates for infusing government with Christian elements, promoting traditional roles and restricting reproductive rights, echoing historical rhetoric used to justify authoritarian measures.\n\n**The Pillars:**\n*Historical Context:*\nThe Third Reich's pillars included backlash against societal changes, anti-communism, nationalism, and resentment post-World War I.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nProject 2025's pillars reflect a consensus view on governance, personnel database management, education, and transition planning, raising concerns about authoritarian tendencies and suppression of dissent.\n\n**A New Police State:**\n*Historical Context:*\nThe Gestapo's brutal tactics and the SS's paramilitary control exemplify historical police state measures under the Third Reich.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nConcerns about Project 2025 leading to a police state in the U.S. are raised, reflecting fears of authoritarian control and suppression of freedoms.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis of Project 2025 reveals parallels to historical events that led to totalitarian regimes. While comparisons provide insights, it's crucial to approach these discussions with objectivity and respect for differing perspectives. By understanding these parallels, we can advocate for democratic values and human rights to prevent erosion of freedoms in modern politics.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://michiganadvance.com/2024/01/16/project-2025-if-allowed-will-cement-america-as-a-rightwing-authoritarian-state/\n\nhttps://www.project2025.org/playbook/\n\nhttps://ghdi.ghi-dc.org/sub_image.cfm?image_id=2048\n\nhttps://www.project2025.org/\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinder,_K%C3%BCche,_Kirche\n\nhttps://msmagazine.com/2024/02/08/project-2025-conservative-right-wing-trump-woke/\n\nhttps://www.dailysignal.com/2023/04/20/4-pillars-project-2025-conservative-plan-undermine-liberal-behemoth-washington/amp/\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Nazi-belts-have-God-with-us-engraved\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/26/what-is-project-2025-trump\n\nhttps://www.heritage.org/press/project-2025-continues-grow-60-partners-preparing-next-presidential-administration\n\nhttps://www.project2025.org/policy/\n\nhttps://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/03/donald-trump-hitler-similarities\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/trump-social-media-account-video-unified-reich/\n\nhttps://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2024/03/13/trump-hitler-putin-kim-jong-un-john-kelly\n\nhttps://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4677700-trumps-latest-flirtation-with-nazi-symbolism-draws-criticism/",
            "Project 2025 is the American version of Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf. Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers Party aka the Nazi Party. The Beer Hall Putsch in 1923, Hitler and his SA \u201cbrown shirts\u201d have made themselves known, and as a result he was thrown in prison where he wrote the book Mein Kampf\u2026outlining all of the plans to consolidate power to the Nazi Party and to Hitler himself by force and violence, to dismantle and abolish the Weimar Republic, and to remove protections of discrimination of certain groups Hitler deemed inferior (Jews, Gypsies, Communists, Bolsheviks, Homosexuals, people with physical and mental disabilitie, and many more), and exterminate them from his Reich. Also for women, body autonomy and abortion was verboten (forbidden)\u2026as Hitler believed that women\u2019s primary roles in Nazi Germany was to the children, kitchen, and church, and that women are to have a bunch of offspring so to purify his Aryan Master Race, for soldiers to fight for Germany, and for wives and mothers to become mere baby factories. Also regarding the Christian nationalism as stated in Project 2025\u2026Hitler also mentions a very interesting similar view when it came to Christianity in Nazi Germany. Hitler has put in that book that he himself believes he is doing the will of God regarding his Nazi ideology more than once. Then people started reading Mein Kampf and it soon became the Bible of Nazi Germany and led to Hitler becoming Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and the Final Solution to be put into work, leading extreme discrimination, torture, and systematically murdering millions in concentration camps\u2026while those who survived were scarred forever living in Hell, and ultimately the Second World War. All because of ONE MAN and his book \u201cMein Kampf\u201d, or to be more specific based on current events,Project 1933. Mein Kampf Project 1933 was not just his autobiography, but a very detailed plan of establishing a fascist mass genocidal dictatorship\u2026which very suspiciously and coincidently \u00a0strongly parallels the modern Project 2025, also involving forceful consolidation of power to the Republican Party, the Executive Branch, and the Republican President; the dismantling of the government, the removal of protections against discrimination of LGBTQ, People of Color, Women, Jews, Muslims, Immigrants, and many more, and the Christian nationalism that Hitler and the Nazi Party enforced with brutality, violence, and murder. Project 2025 is the American version of Mein Kampf also known as Project 1933.\u00a0",

The law aims to produce lower odds of recidivism by incentivizing incarcerated individuals to engage in rigorous, evidence-based rehabilitation and education programming.

Mostly against for treasons of crimes against humanity or civilized living expectations.  Like a court trial before being sentenced to death and sent before a death squad.  Which still isn't civilized, unless it's for treason against the country or it's citizens, reason is a war crime.  But say what you will.\n\nEveryone else playing the Nazi cards, just isn't and hasn't been civilized at all.  And it's showing.  Helping the Jews is what happened.  And, not just any Jews, but overall everyone living under oppressive conditions.

Hitler legitimately had aspirations to make Germany the world's most powerful nation, and to transform it into an empire. Trump ultimately does not care about making America a stronger nation or more respected on the world stage (as evidenced by his actions), he cares about acquiring those things *for himself*.\n\nHe doesn't care about using the role of Commander in Chief of the world's most powerful military to advance America's goals worldwide -he cares about using it to make *he himself* the singular most powerful man on the planet.\n\nHe doesn't care about using the platform / bully pulpit of the US Presidency to inspire, lead, and shape the values of its people - he cares about all the attention and respect it garners *him*. \n\nHe doesn't care about POTUS' status as the \"final arbiter\" of what legislation becomes legally binding in America - he cares about how it makes people vie for *his* approval and grovel for *his* permission. \n\nHe doesn't care about the Executive's ability to nominate judges who will enforce the nation's laws fairly, equally, and without bias - he cares about being able to use it to essentially make *himself* immune to any and all consequences. \n\nThe man is *entirely* ego. It's why the GOP has continually found him so hard to quit - he truly has no guiding ideological compass or principles, and will sign or do anything that feeds his insatiable hunger for attention, power, and respect. He's a blank check for whatever policy preferences you want to advance, so long as you satisfy those conditions. \n\nMost fascist dictators throughout history have held the obsession with power, control, and violence because they believed they alone had the vision necessary to transform their nation into the shape they desired - and they needed that power and control to do so. Donald Trump's obsession with power, control, and violence instead stems from a pathological need to feed his ego - to *feel* powerful; to *feel* a sense of control over other people. \n\nIn other words - IMO - Trump's obsessions with all the aspects of fascism don't stem from a desire to wield them to transform the nation in his image, they stem from a *need* to use them to feed his all-devouring ego.",

If Pence hadn't done his basic Constitutional duty and went along with Trump's seditious, bogus claims of \"vOtEr FrAuD\", they would've created a veneer of legitimacy that would've kept him in power undemocratically - resulting in a coup d'etat. *Which*, it bears repeating, *was the fucking point*.\n\nConservatives would've gone with it, because they'll go with anything that confirms their views, regardless of its moral righteousness or whether it is true or false.\n\nAlso, no one's \"blowing it out of proportion\". A sitting U.S. President tried to stay in power, undemocratically, using violence and absolutely baseless conspiracy theories. Tried to end democracy in this country, and become a dictator.

Of course, retroactively, it's pretty clear that the people *in* the riots were the good guys, and the people (like you) crying about \"decorum\" and \"order\" instead of working to realize equality and justice are very fucking obviously the conservative bad guys, because conservatives don't actually want equality, they want a social hierarchy legally enforced along racial and religious axes, and they're scared to death of losing that forever and having to drink at bars with black people.\n\nAs far as January 6th, the \"mainstream media\" is far, far, *far* more accurate about what happened than the history right-wingers are retroactively trying to revise, because January 6th looks bad, *because it fucking was bad*.

I see him as a sort of ideological contractor and part of a whole breed of political \"entrepreneurs\" in Russia who try to pitch their plans and doctrines to the Kremlin. He pushes a theoretical and mystical hodgepodge of the Iranian Ayatollahs, Boyar Dumas and ancient Greek Sparta.\n\nMy sense is there are people in the security council who share some of his views about an eternal battle with the West like Nikolai Patrushev, but Dugin is really far out, and likes to loudly proclaim all kinds of things, and when the Kremlin does one of those things, he takes credit for it (whether he had anything to do with it or not). That is how he builds his brand. But, like, Dugin proposes to depopulate Russian cities because they're breeding grounds for \"degeneration, alienation and madness.\" He sounds like Pol Pot. Which is not something I think the Russian government believes in. You'll also see him come in for broadside attacks in Moskovsky Komsomlets, which is a major newspaper, so he's clearly not an untouchable figure in Russia.\n\nDugin also tries to interface with political extremists outside of Russia. They are 100% weirdos. He has done this with neo-Nazis in the United States, and also a Brazilian group called Nova Resistencia which espouses a fascist ideology and praises Dugin along with Muammar Gaddafi and Julius Evola. I think he has been more successful at selling himself to these circles. I suspect the Kremlin sees him as useful for this. (He also speaks English very well.) But that goes back to what I was saying in the beginning, it doesn't matter what kind of ideology you have, or what kind of flag you fly, as long as you support Russia. You can be a fascist, a communist, a communo-fascist, or a libertarian, a conservative. It doesn't matter. They don't care. That is distinct from the Soviet Union.",

I think the people who were at the \"Stop the Steal\" rally were wrong, but they have a right to be there. I'm consistent in the application of my political principles - conservatives wouldn't understand. The people on the Capitol Greens had a right to be there. They were voicing their (wrong) opinions. They weren't actively, violently trying to deny the votes of tens of millions of their countrymen and overturn a free and fair election.\n\nThe ones who entered the building, however, *were* abso-fucking-lutely trying to do precisely those things, with the blessing of the then President of the United States. That is so beyond the pale that it boggles my mind that anyone supports him after that point, and the fact that conservatives lined up behind their guy was the moment that I knew American conservatives were not a group of well-meaning people whom I simply had political disagreements with, but people who would sell their countrymen into serfdom and tyranny if it meant they got their way.\n\nThe Clinton supporters bitched far and wide when Trump won in 2016, but nothing will ever top the incredible bitch-fest that conservatives displayed on January 6th, 2021.

It isn't \"fascist\" to deploy force to protect a democratically-elected legislature, and any President with a shred of decency - even one on the way out - would've respected the decision of the American people and fought like hell to protect and preserve these institutions.\n\nUnfortunately, neither Donald Trump nor his supporters are particularly decent.\n\n>you mean in his speech? the speech he was giving an hour into the protest. \n\nLiterally irrelevant, he could've (and, to wit, *should've*) ordered a crackdown on the rioters upon his immediate notice.

Trump supported the riot, *because* he's a fascist, as were his supporters in the Capitol that day. Whine about \"the mainstream media\" all you fucking want, they're right - the facts are what they are, and Trump's actions were indefensible and beneath contempt.\n\n>Like I said, painting all conservatives with this wide brush of being the boogey man is sad. \n\nNot in the least. It's accurate. Nobody forced conservatives to nominate Trump again. Nobody forced conservatives to be such abject, immature liars. You choose to do and to be those things. Nothing I have said has been false - everything Trump said was, yet you continue to stump for the man.

There is a qualitative difference in any verbal errors these two men are making.\n\nThe reason Biden\u2019s are more concerning, is that if he does beat Trump, what will his cognitive decline look like in two/three years? \n\nThere isn\u2019t the same concern with Trump.

            "There is without a doubt a really big disparity in the standards that Biden is held to and the standards that Trump is held to.  I can't think of a politician ever held to such low-standards as Trump.  Not even close.  He has done things that would sink almost any other politician dozens of times.  And so many times he sounds like the biggest moron you've ever heard speak.  Remember the little impromptu musings he had about Gettysburg? If Biden had said that people would have assumed he was either completely demented or else a complete idiot.  Trump says it and it's just funny news for a day.\n\nTrump has done the obscene, the ridiculous, the idiotic things so many times for so long and then the media and other GOP politicians go on to treat him as if he was just a politician.  So all of negatives get normalized.  Fraud?  Adultery?  Rape?  Try to overthrow the govt and threaten democracy?  Ok sure, but I think he might be stronger on the economy.\n\nHowever, in this case I can somewhat understand how people can think this way.  People say they want policy, or change, or whatever, but when looking at a potential leader people react much, much better to someone who comes across as having more vitality and confidence.  \"Strong.\"  And whatever you think of Trump, he definitely comes across with more vitality and confidence than Biden.\n\nBiden could (and has) tried to come out to public appearances with more energy and forcefulness.  But if and when he makes some mistakes in facts or names he gets ridiculed and people worry about his mental state, whereas if Trump makes similar mistakes it gets glossed over.  Again: the double standard.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats care about whether or not Joe Biden is fit to lead, and worry when he doesn not appear to be so.  Not just now.  How will he be in 3-4 years?\n\nOnly Democrats and a few honest (and usually only *former* politicians or officials) conservatives care whether or not Trump is fit to lead.  Conservatives by and large don't worry about it because it is mostly ignored, or glossed over and explained away by the ridiculous media sources they consume, or because they think they can find a way to benefit from it..",

He seems vigorous enough and his voice is usually strong. When he was President, he was pretty accessible, often stopping to speak to reporters. He gave numerous interviews etc. And I think he was asked by Democrats to do a cognitive test and passed. Biden, on the other hand, is our current president so it\u2019s more concerning what is happening with him. He has until lately made very few appearances, hardly any unscripted. When he interacts with reporters, which is seldom, the events are tightly managed. More and more, he exhibits signs of decline in his way of walking and talking. He increasingly appears weak, confused, etc. and numerous Democratic donors and colleagues have made mention of this. I\u2019m worried about him just as a person and hope he is getting whatever care he needs. Making more appearances is helping quell the rumors. I thought he did well enough last night.

It talks as if it is part of a larger, as if it is in a shared system, political commentary system with the Democratic Party.\n\nBut when it talks about Republicans, it talks as if they're a foreign nation, as if it has no agency whatsoever, as if they're reporting on something is happening in distant Russia or distant land where no one reads The Times or cares about it. And because of that, they take on this tone of there's nothing we can do. And it infects all of their coverage.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAgain, as the very wise Jay Rosen put it, the fundamental asymmetry between the two parties fries the circuits of the mainstream press. It either doesn't know how to respond to it, as Jay would say, or it is actively choosing not to try to crack this problem\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom THE DAILY BLAST with Greg Sargent: Trump's Wildly Unhinged Rant At NYT Should Wake Up Media: He's Unfit, Jul 8, 2024\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-daily-blast-with-greg-sargent/id1728152109?i=1000661509356\n\n\n\n\nFrom the shrinking Trump podcast an expert on the dangers of Trump that the the media isn\u2019t covering enough or conveying to the public. \n\n\u201cTrump takes pleasure in saying vicious things about people, the nicknames, the taunting.

It's taking pleasure in diminishing somebody else.\n\nIt's not enough to win, right? You have to humiliate and disfigure and castrate and humiliate the person you're winning over. It's not like, good match.\n\nIt's more like, now I beat you, now let me rip your heart out and eat it in front of your family.\n\nIt's being a sore winner.\n\nThat's why he's so competitive and always putting down any other president, living or dead.\n\nThe overwhelming urge, you got to be number one. You got to win every moment. It's hardwired, it's immutable, and it's going to govern.\n\nIt governs his debate performance. It's going to govern his behavior if he gets back into the Oval Office.

That will magnify the issues of course. \n\nI also think Trump surrounds himself with a well oiled machine made up of people who are willing to just make the excuses for him. This has been his whole life, just surrounded by enablers who find the right things to say or do that will give him the plausible deniability to walk away. You can find lots of articles or videos from before he was a politician with people talking about stuff like him being on uppers, wearing adult diapers, having a smell, saying racist things, assaulting women, etc, but these things never stick because whomever he surrounds himself with is very loyal and willing to just make it go away or muddy the waters on his behalf. People are already forgetting, but there was something recently where Trump was just saying something absolutely insane in front of Congress and you had multiple different versions of what actually happened from the Republicans who were there. Some deny that he ever said it and it was false news, others were spinning it, some were just changing the quote entirely to make him sound much more intelligent, etc. \n\nI know that conservatives are going to come in and say that the same things happen with Biden, and I'm not going to deny that. They definitely do. But I think his enablers do not stretch themselves or bend over backwards in the same way that Trump's do. There is an entire machine like I said that is working around the clock to protect Trump.

The issue is two fold, a candidate that can keep Trump from winning and a candidate that can make it through their term. If Harris was viewed more popular the second might not be as big of a deal but she\u2019s not.\n\nBiden unfortunately gets the greater attention because of this. Trump leading in poles isn\u2019t a reflection of Trumps popularity but how negative Biden is being viewed. The Democrats best chance at winning is running a better candidate, it would literally take away any reason for independents to look at Trump and could sway moderate conservatives that really don\u2019t like Trump but hate Biden. This could change but right now this election is shaping up to be a referendum on Biden and not Trump. With a well selected candidate this could be switched and Trump easily loses. If Biden continues it\u2019s still possible he could win but the chances aren\u2019t looking good at least as of now.\n\nI wish they would both go away personally but that\u2019s how I\u2019m seeing this playing out as of right now and so far the last few weeks haven\u2019t seem to help Biden but hurt him. If your base and down ballot don\u2019t support him he\u2019s very likely to lose. I do think the calls for him to step down will stop after the convention if he survives that long but by then the damage might be done severely hurting his chances of winning.",

It's a narrative with mass market appeal.\n\nThe truth is without this age issue, Biden would probably be a shoe-in for re-election. The economic data isn't nearly bad enough to all the sudden put Trump back into the driver's seat. The two camps are so solidly entrenched that it would be quite a surprise to see voters switch sides. In the end it's going to be a question of turn-out and of course a handful of swing states.",

He's said it and not in jest he will fill every position possible with yes men and women asskissers that will turn us into the Kremlin East.

You could argue his inconstancy and disregard for truth means he simply doesn't *have* to try and organize a proper train of thought.\n\nIf anything, the incoherence of the huckster routine is probably a selling point. Lets him jump to the next semi-random tangent quicker.\n\nSo you have a pretty wide gap in expectations. It dogged Clinton in 2016. Dogged Biden in 2020. Still is now.

While of course there is room in democratic politics for grievance candidates, they don't tend to do as well or get as far. Those on the left (relative to US politics that is, I know the Dems in most European countries would not be considered the left at all), care far more about causes and policies than grievance, and therefore, candidates have a higher standard of at least showing some level of personal integrity and competence to do the job.\n\nNow I know some of you are rolling your eyes, cause there have of course been some major democratic corrupt buffoons, but I am speaking in relative terms here, as in relative to the democratic party. There is no Democratic Trump. The is no democratic Marjorie Taylor Green. There is no Democratic Lauren Boebert. Arguably there is no Democratic Matt Gaetz. The racial whackadoo fringe elements of the Dem party are like....AOC, who, whether you agree with her politics or not, is still quite manifestly FAR more informed and competent and Gaetz or Boebert or Taylor Green.\n\nSo to bring that back to answer your question: Because what Donald Trump is doesn't matter, his personal competencies are irrelevant, he serves as a conduit for grievance and that's all he needs to do. I'm sure 80% of the GOP would be quite content if he just fucked off to Mar a Lago for the rest of his life and played golf and just signed whatever the freedom caucus put in front of him.\n\nMeanwhile Biden is expected to actually do things, have ideas, lead, be effective, pursue politics and policies and agendas and negotiate and lead and govern. So his personal capacity matters a lot more to his constituents than Trumps does to his.\n\nSo yes, even though Trump is prone to completely incoherent angry rants, that's all they need to be, angry ranting grandpa. Who gives a shit if he cant remember what he was talking about half the time, the theme of the angry rant is obviously anti-woke and anti-immigrant, and that's all they need.",

During the debate Trump was always reacting and making faces to whatever came out of Biden's mouth and was clearly listening to him closely so he could make some quip after Biden fucked up. Whereas when Trump was talking, Biden was just standing there slack jawed staring into the abyss looking like he just woke up on the podium and has no idea where he is or what Trump is saying.\n\nBiden also had to be helped down from the stage afterwards like he was about to keel over. He just seems so much worse and the change more alarming.",

He started stammering every time a reporter asked him again why he wouldn\u2019t step down and I get that - how many different ways can you say it? On the other hand, we have never heard Trump discuss policy with any level of expertise. His speeches are surface level platitudes, insults and bluster. Clearly he learned nothing as president.

Trump's gaffes are treated like Dubya's gaffes back in the '00s.\n\nIt\u2019s also because Biden\u2019s seen as competent why his performance at the debate hurts him so much.

So, there's a natural instinct to go \"Trump is the same Trump he always has been, but Biden has lost a step.\"\n\nThe difference is that Biden is old, and maybe has lost a step, but Trump is an absolute lunatic.\n\nMoreover, Trump's supporters do not care what he says. They don't care about his surrogates, Project 2025, or any of the absolutely insane stuff going on around him. He gives them a permission structure to be the worst versions of themselves to people they blame for where they're at in life or just don't like.\n\nFundamentally, Biden is a politician and Trump is a cult leader.",

People expect Trump to be like this, but they expect it because they think he literally doesn't care (this is the guy who was flailing his hands around making fun of a disabled person during his presidential campaign).  \n\nWith Biden, people expect him to make minor gaffes, that's how he's always been.

In order to help themselves, they stick their finger on the scales and keep the heat on the guy who's about taxing the wealthy to benefit the poor while providing tax benefits to the middle class by eliminating the ability of multi-billion dollar businesses to not pay taxes at all. Democracy doesn't matter to most of the wealthy wannabe lords and ladies - keeping an extra million or two for their kids' trust funds does, though.

We're just more numbers to them, and they're taking advantage of our trust in their impartiality/reporting.

He's constantly confusing things. He doesn't get people's names correct or countries names. He even confuses Biden for Obama, 8 times in the last year. .\u00a0\nHe even said just the other week that, Don Jr has a good wife.

            "> He says some crazy stuff, but it's said with confidence, intent.\n\nThis is the key thing. Trump is a bullshitter, and it is obvious as you watch him speak that he does not care about the truth content of his words. If he mixes up details, it's not because he had a cognitive lapse, it's because he simply doesn't give a shit. He has mastery over his own thoughts and memory, but he is not focused on relaying true details; he is focused on working the crowd and hitting the talking points he wants to drive home, and cares precisely zero about substance, nuance, detail, etc.\n\nTrump is showing signs of early cognitive decline, to be clear. I think if Trump does get reelected, it is quite likely that by 2028 he'll be as deteriorated then as Biden is today. But Biden's decline as of today is starker and more advanced. Biden often loses his train of thought, trails off, fails to connect ideas coherently, and there are moments where he literally speaks gibberish. He does not have the obvious intent behind his words that Trump does, he does not have obvious awareness and mastery of his own thoughts.",

            "Yeah, I mean Biden has made a few appearances just in the past couple weeks and in almost every one, or at the least one of every two, there is some kind of major gaffe. Just the other day he gave one speech where he introduced Zelenskyy as President Putin, and then gave a press conference where he referred to Kamala Harris as Vice President Trump. \n\nTrump has gaffes but they\u2019re pretty far between, and if you listen to an entire Trump speech, as I did the other day out of some weird spirit of masochism and curiosity, he can talk for an hour without having a gaffe. \n\nTrump also clearly speaks off the cuff all the time. Perhaps to a fault. He goes on tangents and rambles about things and tells weird stories. But they\u2019re still coherent. Biden is usually speaking prepared lines off a teleprompter, or else answering pre-screened questions with notes on hand, and he seems to struggle to get through 10-20 minutes. If you were to calculate the amount of time Trump and Biden have each spoken in front of a camera during the last 7 months, I would be willing to bet the minutes of Trump speaking would add up to at least two or three times more. Possibly much more than that. If you were to somehow only compare speech which was not read from a prepared script, the difference would be even more staggering.\n\nTrump\u2019s still a narcissistic maniac, and he\u2019s obviously experienced cognitive decline if you compare his present speech to videos of him from the 2000s or 1990s. He does have embarrassing gaffes sometimes, particularly with mixing up or mispronouncing people\u2019s names. But Biden really is on another level, and acting like Trump has gaffes of the same extent and with even remotely similar frequency (especially in consideration of how much more often he speaks off the cuff on camera) is kind of crazy.",

            "I think you just nailed it. Thanks.",
            "Agreed.\n\n- With Trump, it's already priced in. With Biden, the attempt to deny it for so long and shield him from unscripted moments has led to a downward correction in perception which feels largely the same as a sudden decline would.\n- With Trump, he's constantly in the spotlight so, much like you don't notice yourself growing old when you see yourself in the mirror every day, we don't really notice any decline that there is. Meanwhile, with Biden, the attempt to reduce his unscripted moments has made the change much more noticeable when we do finally hear one.\n\nIt's also perhaps a matter of baselines. Biden was a guy with normal temperament who was very knowledgeable of his field. So, seeing him slow down and seeing him struggle at details is noticeable and different from what we're used to. Meanwhile, Trump was a hyped up guy who talked out of his a\\*\\*. (Remember him talk about the nuclear triad in 2015?) So, slowing down with age may even be *helpful* (I think it helped his 2024 debate performance). Meanwhile, if he doesn't know some technical thing, that doesn't seem like decline it seems like standard Trump. Meanwhile the fact that he knew nothing in 2016 (recently claimed he didn't know what NATO was) means that even if he retains 1/10th of what he absorbed in the presidency, he appears to know more now even if there were decline.\n\nSimilarly, it's also a measure of assessing the candidate in the context of why somebody would vote for them. I don't think anybody ever expected Trump to be getting deep into policy meetings, etc. I think instead people (voters, supporters, politicians, etc.) expect Trump to set very high level policy goals/priorities and let people figure it out. So, in that context, it doesn't really matter if he knows the detail if his supporters don't expect he'll use the details. Meanwhile, I think a lot of the reason why people support Biden is that they believe he has a wealth of knowledge and experience in policy. Against that measure, it really matters if that knowledge and experience is getting all jumbled up. Considering that, that's why it's such a shame that Biden's campaign is focusing so much on policy achievements and policy issues rather than similarly framing him as a more hands off wise man where his detailed knowledge wouldn't be as relevant.",

Biden slurs a word here and there - nothing to see here! Trump slurs a word here and there - proof of dementia!\n\nVerbal flubs are not proof of dementia (and for the record I don't think either of them have it).

Now he has an almost manic, frantic train of thought that just pours out of him. Most of the time he can't even finish a sentence before he's switched to a different, unrelated topic.",

Dr. Vince Greenwood is also back on the show to help us evaluate the signs of aging and cognitive decline shown from both candidates.\u201d\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/shrinking-trump/id1745797271?i=1000661268788",

            "I know, but I could still see Trump saying the thing about Einstein!",
            "I don't think you are thinking like the media, and what they actually care about:\n\nThe media doesn't WANT Biden. He is boring. The biggest news is his gaffs, and that he is old. That doesn't make a lot of clicks, which doesn't make a lot of money.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, continously for the past 8 years, has been in the news, every single day, for every crazy thing he says. When he wqs president, those crazy, hateful, un-American, etc things he said/did was big news. Tons of clicks. Lots of money.\n\nOnce he left office, the people began to get tired of hearing about a NON president saying those things, and the clicks slowed down. He needs to be crazy, and in office, to get their pockets full again. Because when Private citizen Trump calls for fight clubs for illegal immigrants, nobody really cares... But if the president called for that, it would be big news again.\n\nAnd then as mentioned, the biggest news Biden has is the occasional gaff, and being old (and even the old angle is just a side reasoning for the gaffs any more). So that is all they CAN talk about for him. Other than that, he is boring, and getting the job done.\n\nThe media actually, btw, DOES report on everything. But only the things that end up being popular (and \"viral\") are the things we see through thr clutter of millions of news stories published each day.\n\nThe real issue, to your concern, is less what they are reporting on, and more what people are clicking on. As usual, it is the general boredom of Americans that is the problem. We, the people, may rather have a good country, but we will make the media money with bad things that happens. Outrage sells more than competency.",
            "Trump is a bullshit artist, he projects so much confidence when he speaks that he sounds coherent and competent to gullible people even if what he's saying is nonsense.\n\nIt's the same schtick he's been doing since the apprentice, and unfortunately it works on many people.",
            "The debate was not over hyped. It was Biden\u2019s best chance to course correct , 50 million people tuned in and all saw Biden standing there like a vegetable. It\u2019s the biggest thing that\u2019s happened this cycle and probably the most important tv debate since Kennedy-Nixon.",
            "> but special elections tell a different story\n\nThey do, but [democrats have recently had great success with suburbanites](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/) who find Trump boorish and vulglar, and had [racial minorities shift heavily away from them](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/03/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html) (and that's not just from the debate, [it's been happening for a while](https://www.natesilver.net/p/democrats-are-hemorrhaging-support)).\n\nWe would expect democrats to do much better with that coalition during off year elections, just like republicans did back in the 2000s with suburbanites in their coalition (the old line was that Republicans would show up with 2 hours notice to vote for a ham sandwich with an R next to its name). We see this in the cross tabs I linked, Biden is only down by 6 among likely voters, but down by 8 across all registered voters. The thing is, presidential elections traditionally bring out a lot more of the unlikely voters. The higher turnout we see normally see in presidential years is probably good for Trump here.",
            "Sure, that\u2019s true.  But you can see it in the data already. Down ballot democrats are polling AHEAD of Biden.

Across the board in swing states the Democratic candidates for Senator are polling ahead of him by an average of 9 points.\n\nHis weakness in the polls is unique to him.",

            "Yeah absolutely, to add to this, Trump had been reading a PSA display that listed \"disinfectants\" as \"bleach and alcohol\" moments before. The idea that Trump didn't suggest injecting bleach as a possible solution to fighting COVID is purely at odds with reality. Biden didn't even come close to lying.",

Go back and read a printed transcript which doesn\u2019t have the pauses or stammering and you won\u2019t find it hard to understand.\n\nHe was absolutely tired, he was also sick, and I think he was also just dumbfounded at the barrage of lies and bullshit coming unchecked out of Trump\u2019s mouth. Should he have been faster to respond to it? Maybe. But honestly, there is never a time in the execution of the duties of the president when they have to have an argument with somebody who\u2019s lying atthem belligerently. Or at all. So whether he could do that during a debate with Trump or not has no bearing on if he\u2019s capable of doing the job. We know he\u2019s capable of doing the job because he\u2019s literally doing it every day.",

            "Very interesting. So you think that this notion that the media \"hates\" Trump is unfounded? Regardless of what they think about the man personally, they love his ability to generate clicks and views. When the media puts out Trump's gaffes, it generates ad revenue. The media, which skews liberal (because society skews liberal, and more and more liberal over time) needs conservative heels, to \"attack\", to create drama that becomes ad revenue. Alternatively, more conservative leaning media has all of the outrage they need built in as most media leans liberal because societies naturally become more liberal over time (and that influences media which of course is run by people and targets people for revenue), so conservatives are always on the defensive, so they will always have something to be outraged about, hence a steady flow of clicks views and ad revenue.",

However, I suspect 95% of NPR, NYT and WashPost reporters are voting for Biden.  I think there are two things going on with the way media coverage is going right now with those outlets\n\nI think the rank and file staff are reflecting their own anxieties into the content.  They're obsessed with Biden losing to Trump and it's inconceivable to them that everyone doesn't already know who Trump is\n\nSecond, they're all taught in journalism school that they should be impartial and report the facts and they want to believe that's who they are.  Trump completely breaks this.  If the report on the facts about Trump's lies, etc, they know they'll lose credibility with 50% of the electorate, so they pretend to cover \"both sides\", which in fact actually makes them favor Trump in practice, by refusing to call out his lies, etc.",

The voter that they are concerned about losing is the swing state guy who doesn\u2019t pay a lot of attention and is very susceptible to sound bites and ads. Heck, they spend hundreds of millions on repetitive adds for a reason. The optics of Biden freezing and looking confused, combined with Trump screaming that everything wrong in your life is Biden\u2019s fault, make for a STEEP uphill climb for Biden. Everyone who is paying attention is still going to vote for him - we\u2019re just worried that our neighbors won\u2019t.\n\nIf Biden\u2019s approval rating were 80% and he were up in the polls, no one would be calling for his removal. \n\nWhy does Trump get a pass? Because he appeals to something primal in people and they ignore the rest. He\u2019s a lying circus showman populist. People don\u2019t care how he makes the sausage, as long as they get their piece. That\u2019s not necessarily a left/right thing.",

Heck, I'll be honest, as someone who *did* stay throughout the debate, Biden's biggest problem is that he looked *and sounded* sick throughout the whole thing. Trump, on the other hand, literally sounded like a man on a mission who wouldn't let facts get in the way of that mission. Heck, this entire \"we need to get Biden out as our candidate now\" line of thought sometimes feels like a conspiracy theory come true.",

The democrats were the same party the whole time, just different world events worth targeting is all.\n\nAdditionally, it is really up to speculation just how many Trump supporters strongly resembles the Republican demographic, or conservatives as a whole. A lot of people are just that, supporters. I am a supporter of Biden, doesn't mean I like him or think he is a great president, or even good.

That said, for any elected Republican official, it is worth looking at how their own opinions may differ from the platform as to whether or not they should be labelled MAGA. On the Democratic side, to give an example that you may be more familiar with, one shouldn't assume that AOC and Joe Manchin have the same policy ideas. Likewise, Registered Republicans may or may not be themselves MAGA, though if they're voting for Trump, they're certainly supporting a MAGA president.\n\nAll that said, the Republican Party is the Republican Party.

However, the situation with MAGA is different as of March 2024.\n\n\n\nAs an analogy, communism is an extreme left-wing position and the Communist Party USA has positions that greatly differ from the Democratic party\u2019s positions, even though they might have some overlap at times due to both being on the left side of the spectrum. So even if a group of Democratic officials began pushing highly communistic policies, this wouldn\u2019t justify labeling the entire Democratic party as communist. However, if the Democratic party fully embraced nearly all of the Communist party\u2019s policies, regardless of which traditional Democratic policies they kept, and at the same time purged the party of any members who would not fully embrace all communist policies fully, at that point it would be fair to say that the Democratic party is no longer the Democratic party but is in fact the Communist party masquerading as the Democratic party.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is what\u2019s happened with the Republican party. Prior to March 2024, yes, it would be unfair to call the Republican party MAGA even if it was highly influenced by it, but as of the takeover and purge in March, I would say it\u2019s now fair to say that the Republican party has been infiltrated by MAGA to the point that it\u2019s now purely MAGA masquerading as Republican.",

            "If there\u2019s truth to your theory, Trump\u2019s post-conviction surge must be a sign of huge trouble.\n\nBut to answer more seriously, I think it could equally signify that supporters are paying attention and waking up to the fact that they need to contribute more than just hollow words and a trip to the voting booth in order to defeat Trump. A fair number of supporters likely felt convinced until now that, despite what polls were saying, Biden\u2019s win was a sure thing after Democratic successes in 2022 and more recent races like the Jacksonville FL mayoral race.",
            "I think it\u2019s likely a little of both. Trump didn\u2019t help himself in that debate\u2026but Biden hurt himself. And there\u2019s a world of difference between those two concepts. Trump undoubtedly lost, but Biden sure as hell didn\u2019t win.\n\nNow, having said that\u2026I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to change horses mid-race. Do I think Biden has been perfect? Absolutely not. But one bad night does not erase 3 and a half years of amazing, forward, progressive accomplishments. Nor does it erase Trump\u2019s lifetime of blatant criminality, or his demonstrated inability to lead this country. While I\u2019d vote for a wet paper bag before I\u2019d ever risk Trump getting back into the White House, I think such a heavy-duty change up to the Democratic ticket would do more harm than good at this point. \n\nFirst of all, no one has come forward saying they will confidently take his place if Biden steps down. Second, even if something like that were to happen, the new candidate would only have *~5 months* to make the case to the American people why they should be elected. Furthermore, no one has raised a penny of campaign money for ads or events. \n\nI firmly believe that a new candidate so late in the game would fracture the Democratic Party to such an extent that it would easily hand Trump the win. Biden isn\u2019t perfect\u2026but we\u2019re not electing a man so much as we\u2019re electing an administration\u2026and a potential second Biden administration is *unquestionably* better than a second Trump administration.\n\nFinally, I just want everyone to think about this \u2014 If, god forbid, Trump wins in November, Supreme Court justices Alito and Thomas will very likely retire, giving Trump 2 more extreme MAGA picks. Think about the possibility of Supreme Court Justice Aileen Cannon. It absolutely could happen.\n\nSo I encourage everyone to think long and hard about voting for a candidate who is old, but is honorable and absolutely cares about this country and its people. Or we can risk electing a malignant narcissist who doesn\u2019t care one bit about the American people, and is *only* running to keep himself out of prison. The choice could not be easier.",
            "It could be, it could also just be a continuing trend that Biden has just been outdoing Trump in fundraising. The first 5 months of this year, Biden declared $212m on hand vs Trump's $170m, and that was after the monetary influx Trump received post conviction. Post debate, Biden received an additional $33m versus Trump's $8m.\n\nSo maybe a bit of panic contributions, but just as likely that Biden is just bringing in more money.",
            "I'm one of the folks in the surge, I donated during and after debate and the day after. I liked what Biden said at the debate and I liked the message he had at the end. I'm just trying to show support to that.\n\n\nPrior to this I would donate once a quarter.",
            "People don\u2019t want to see Trump have another chance to continue destroying the institutions of our democracy.  Biden is the only chance to stop Trump this election, so of course people are going to step up after being reminded that Trump is a lying felon who is dangerous and unmoored from reality.",
            "I didn't see any details about where the money from (big donors vs tons of small donors), but I wonder if some large donors were already planning on giving and were told to time it after the debate for optics.",

            "It's desperation from die hards, just like Trumps surge after the conviction. It's an attempt to make it seem like things are okay when they aren't. It doesn't convince me whatsoever, especially compared to the $$ Trump got",
            "There is no way to repair the damage Biden did in that debate. It would be political suicide to still run him. He no longer has the confidence of his own party.

I do think Biden has moved the ball in a better direction.\n\nBut that debate proved that he\u2019s either got the wrong people in his inner circle or that he\u2019s not able to stand up after a stressful 7 days.\n\nAt this point I am hoping if Biden is the actual candidate that Harris is up to the task.  She may well very be.  I like what I have seen from her in the last month.. but the fucking Democratic Party should have been pushing her into the limelight the last 4 years, because every year Biden is elected for is another year of risk that we may not get the Biden we elected.",

To replace him with anyone else except *maybe* Kamala Harris is to toss the primary and anoint someone else, which has terrible optics and is *easy* to run against.\n\nAnd yet I don't think Kamala at the top of the ticket wins either.  If Biden had died two years ago and she had real incumbent status, maybe?  But absent that, no.",
            "Help get the vote out",
            "I\u2019m not sure I know what that even means. The last 3.5 years have been fantastic, relatively speaking. And if Biden wins in November, I have every reason to think that the next 4 years would be similar. Whether he makes it through another 4 years is an open question\u2026but so what? I\u2019m not so much voting for the man as I am his administration, who I have *every* confidence in. \n\nConversely, I have absolutely *zero* confidence in any administration/cabinet Trump would surround himself with, and every reason to think they would only take us backward.\n\nSo, when it comes to which direction either candidate and their administration would take us, Biden/Harris would take us forward, while Trump would take us backward.\n\nSeems like a pretty easy decision to me which is better.",
            "Or that... He just fucked up at a debate.  Like, sometimes that just happens, and that's all there is to it. It doesn't necessarily mean anything other than the most obvious thing.   He was probably so worried about doing what he did, that  he psychologically trapped himself in that rabbit hole and then the harder he tried to brush it off and climb out, the further down the hole he slipped.  \n\nMiss South Carolina did the same thing when reciting her famous speech that everybody's seen. But no, it didn't mean she's dumb, has the wrong people in her inner circle, or really imply anything broadly at all besides that she's human, just like the president is human.  I think when you're in a humiliating situation and are feeling embarrassed the tendency is for the to make your situation worse and not better.  I'm sure his age, over preparation, etc. were contributing factors. But I don't think we can draw these broad conclusions over what occurred without more information, which we don't have. They're all based on assumptions.  \n\nI'm not saying it's excusable for the sitting president to fail so spectacularly at public speaking.  As someone who's warmed up to Biden during his first term I felt personally let down by my candidate, especially because I know public perception is so important to voters, and to the citizens when they listen to their leader.  Like imagine if after 9/11 Bush gave a speech where he kept losing his train of thought, misremembered facts and figures, and said the absolute wrong words that made 0 sense.... right at a time when the nation needed strength and unity.  Those post 9/11 months may have turned out very differently in terms of the national spirit. Not that I liked Bush or his actions, so maybe we could've saved trillions on war and would've instead invested the money in health care or education or a collection of mint condition SNES RPGs for the nation enjoy. \n\n I'm in no way minimizing what happened. It was a train wreck and he may have contributed to the potential fall of the United States based on the project 2025 plan if Republicans win.  I felt sick and couldn't sleep that night I hated seeing that so much.  \n\nBut we need to stop reading so deep into it. He done fucked up, it was humiliating, but that was that.  \n\nI hope as some have suggested that he bombards the country with prime time interviews on every major outlet.   As the man stated himself, he fell off his horse but all he can do is get back on.  \n\nReally instead of a debate we need a back to back pair of tough interview from our nation's top journalists against each candidate.  This format would be so much more useful to the public.  Trump's true colors become so obvious in these situations so I doubt he'd agree. But Biden can go ahead and do them, and perhaps call attention to ones trump has previously done.   \n\nThis kind of communication from a candidate shows how they speak to people one on one, how tough and solid they really are if they had to negotiate face to face with a national adversary.  Would give a deep dive into the policies they support(ed), expose them when they were not being truthful, and overall give a much better picture of each man and their personal character than a debate.  That's all performance theatrics and always has been.  \n\nGo back to when Mitt Romney said Russia was the #1 biggest threat and Obama quipped that the Cold War called and they want their politics back.  This played again and again and made Mitt look out of touch and Obama so cool and suave.  But Mitt was correct and perhaps if he was being interviewed by a journalist he could've laid out his case instead of losing due to inferior on stage theatrics.",
            "\n\nPrioritizing having a young candidate (which isn't going to happen) over defeating Trump is tragically naive.\n\nI like how you are so hellbent on ditching Biden but have no procedural know of how that's going to happen. He's won all the primaries. You're treating this like replacing batteries in a flashlight.\n\nThrowing away incumbent advantage and the warchest Biden has built up for the fall general election campaign because Biden's old?\n\nThat's playing checkers when you should be playing chess.",
            "This is kind of my point.  While I absolutely do not want Trump to win, I also want to move the ball in the right direction over the next four years.  The president needs to convince the majority (not just 45%) that they are capable of leading the US in a direction that is absolutely the different direction than both parties have been doing.  Yes, we can elect Biden and just move this problem 4 years down the road.  The problem isn\u2019t Trump.  He\u2019s nothing more than a lightning rod.  The problem is convincing at least 60-70% of the people that we can absolutely do more than the shitshow that we have.",
            "Sticking with the incumbent isn't complacent.\n\nPretending Biden would be replaced by a young candidate and prioritizing that over defeating Project 2025 is tragically naive.",
            "Uhh, I think if anything Trump wants Biden to stay in the race. \n\n\nIn any of your \"real world\" conversations, have you ever run across someone who was enthusiastic about either the two choices before them? I can't imagine that opinion improved for Biden after this week. \n\nI don't care what anyone says on here, that debate did irreparable damage to Biden. \n\nI've never voted Democrat, but I can't vote Trump. I'll probably just sit it out. That said, from a disinterested voter, I'll definitely tell you...the dems have a problem they MUST address, or they're walking into another 2016.",
            "Friend, literally 80% of the people on Reddit will vote for his corpse over Trump, hell even if Biden was an open pedophile they\u2019d still vote for the guy. But that doesn\u2019t matter, the \u201cvote blue no matter who\u201d are the same as the MAGA cultists and similarly, you guys don\u2019t decide the vote. The swing voters actually want a president that can finish their term, and Biden is not the guy. You might vote for Biden, your friends might either but the swing voters will probably just vote based on vibes",
            "You are completely missing my point.  Did you actually read my post?  We want to replace Biden because it is looking increasing likely that he cannot defeat Trump.\n\nI don\u2019t care about having a young candidate.  I\u2019d gladly take an old one that can actually win.  At this point I\u2019d be fine with HRC filling his spot.\n\nIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s \u201cold\u201d, it\u2019s that he can barely express a coherent thought.  It\u2019s disingenuous to pretend that we just care about his age.  Polling shows that his incumbency advantage is pretty much null and void.  As far as I\u2019ve seen, he doesn\u2019t have a war chest - he doesn\u2019t even have plastic toy soldiers.",
            "Young progressives are putting the cart before the horse.\n\n1-Biden has already won the primaries. The only extreme outlier would be to have a brokered convention where delegates change who they're voting for. The odds that this is going to happen is so low that it's not worth talking about. BUT let's say it does happen. You think a bunch of Democrat insiders are going to choose a young progressive? o.O That has no basis in reality.\n\n2-When are you going to realize that the presidency is not the first step to shifting the country in a more progressive direction? The main progressive achievement over the past decade has been establishing a foothold in Congress.\n\n3-A progressive president with no congressional backing will be absolutely hamstrung from making any significant progress. You need to build up congressional representation before you do anything else.\n\n4-Biden has cancelled student loans and is now listening to Bernie and planning tax the rich, but you have been attacking him since January.\n\n5-If you want a progressive anything in the future, you MUST defeat Project 2025 in November or else it's not going to happen.\n\nThis whole 'Oh look! Biden had a bad debate; now is our chance to replace him with a young progressive' is completely divorced from reality.",
            "Exactly.  I absolutely do not want Trump to win, that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t also be livid at the Democratic Party for yet another shitshow election where Trump is a real threat.  They fucked it up with putting Hillary in when they did and they damn sure fucked it up by prepping Biden.\n\nThere is a disease in the Democratic Party that has to stop, because people like me that vote \u201cnot fascist\u201d ARE going to vote for the first sane person in the race, be that this election or the next.",
            "But why is it so important that he live out his term if his administration is able to finish the job he starts? \n\nKamala Harris is intelligent, capable, and absolutely qualified to lead if Biden should die before the end of his term. I don\u2019t see the problem here.",

I don\u2019t really view politicians as saints.\n\nAnd I honestly don\u2019t like Kamala Harris, she lacks charisma and I genuinely think she\u2019s extremely selfish.",

And in *this* moment, in this *this* time, I find that to be satisfactory.\n\nIronically enough, in Trump's first term, he actually had people around him that would at least attempt to check his worst impulses. Do you really think he'll make that \"mistake\" again? Of course not! He absolutely *will* surround himself with sycophants and yes-men who will never tell him 'no' -- A far more dangerous prospect if you ask me.",

Another example of how you don't understand this process and this replacing Biden is like changing flashlight batteries. It's not.\n\nI'll close by pointing out that, if you lose your account password, which is connected to email, you don't name your new account throwaway. Throwaway accounts are for concealing identities.\n\nAnd I'm done engaging with you, Mr. Throwaway.",

And I would also like to add that we\u2019re still dealing with a border crisis, inflation, multiple wars erupting all over the world, the Israel-Hamas war, political unrest in the country, growing concerns about Biden\u2019s age, a DNC infighting to replace Biden and etc. I predict these factors will inevitably cause a Trump victory come November. \n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t think Biden will win this election. It\u2019s a repeat of 2016. And I would like to add that you might be ok with Biden and his current team but many, including the blue base, are do not share the same view. 2020 was barely won and even a few couple thousand staying home in Election Day will have a massive impact on the results",
            "I'm unfortunately forced to agree with almost everything you just said.\n\nThat's not a reflection on you personally...just that I find the prospect of your observations to be incredibly troubling and frightening considering what Trump will do to this country if he were to ever gain that kind of power again...even worse considering the Supreme Court just basically made him a king."

            "Still not very successful at all. Ron DeSantis was always going to crash and burn on the national stage and it didn't matter who he would face. He's an awful candidate. If Trump didn't run it would have been Nikki Haley as the nominee.\n\nDeSantis simply does not have the people skills or relatability to succeed as a presidential nominee. He has no charisma whatsoever and comes off as extremely awkward. He struggles with public events and interacting with people in general. He gets thrashed in debates and frequently looks like a fool.\n\nTrump would simply insult him as he always did and that would be that. It would work and did work because even people who would be inclined to vote for DeSantis think he's a damn weirdo, which is true. However, even if it wasn't ol' Ronny is simply trying to emulate Trump and failing. The general consensus among Republican voters who would choose between the two really seems to be: Why would I want the imitation when I can have the real thing right over there?\"",
            "He has no original thoughts and he\u2019s as charismatic as a scantron. If Trump didn\u2019t exist, maybe he has a solid shot at winning the primary. Maybe. But he reminds me of a 2024 version of Rick Perry.",
            "Not successful. People have tied themselves to Trump, so attacking Trump as a \"loser\" will cause his voters to take it personally.",
            "His campaign had similar vibes to Jeb\u2019s \u201cplease clap\u201d campaign. Sounded great on paper, but when you go see him in person, you could hear the farting sound of air rushing out of the balloon.",
            "0% the problem isn't DeSantis, it's the base. Until the base removes their lips from trumps anus nobody has a chance to run against him. It wasn't the anti woke rhetoric, or Trump wouldn't have ever gotten the nominee, it is entirely a matter of the fact that in the GOP you kiss the ring or you lose. The issues don't matter, the outcomes don't matter, allegiance to Trump matters.",
            "I\u2019m going to disagree with the prevailing consensus here.\n\nIf he had started off going for the jugular right after the disastrous midterms, he might\u2019ve been successful. The problem is he tried to have it both ways. Had he successfully tied red hats with being losers in mid-November 2022 he might have succeeded. Instead he wanted their votes and he was always gonna come in second.\n\nAdd to that his position on abortion in the wake of Dobbs, and he was done.  There is an alternate world where he campaigns on Trump being a loser and on a 15 a week ban, and he wins the nomination. \n\nIt\u2019s maybe not a realistic world, but it could\u2019ve happened.",
            "Trumpism doesn\u2019t work without trump, the most trumpy senate and governor candidates have crashed and burned in every swing state election since 2016 because no one else can activate the trump coalition.\n\nThis is also the reason he\u2019s the nominee the party has gotten behind without him there\u2019s no GOP coalition.",
            "It would go as well as florida is going right now. I sure didn't move out of Florida cause he was doing a great job running out",
            "The best thing Ron DeSantis had going for him was that nobody knew anything about him. Once voters learned anything about him at all, his numbers went down. \n\nHad it been an open Republican primary, DeSantis would have come like 7th, and his base would have still been uninformed voters.",
            "There's no timeline where Trump is alive and able to run for office where he doesn't win the Republican nomination, and there's a few more timelines he wins in besides those.",
            "DeSantis could not hold his own in a debate against Newsom, and would have been ripped to small bits in a Trump-attack.",
            "Ron DeSantis just looks like a Scooby Doo villain trying to disguise himself as Ron DeSantis.",
            "I have yet to hear a coherent definition of what \"Woke\" means.  It's bantered about like a 4-letter word for politicians.  Yet I still have no idea what \"Woke\" is.  It sounds like a stupid term which has no actual meaning.",
            "Not much i think. The whole trump brand is being the biggest loser and shamelessly acting like the opposite. Trump base completely identifies with that and there is nothing that can take it away from them except a decent education that can fix their loserness",
            "People seem to forget that classical presidential candidates used to try to be the middle between the two parties and try to find consensus amongst voters.\n\nIt is within the last 10-15 years that it has been a race to either end of the political spectrum for both parties.\n\nBefore the focus was on voter turnout of all voters. Now it\u2019s shifted to making the other party\u2019s voters apathetic enough to not vote.",
            "Doesn\u2019t DeSantis base love Trump?  I don\u2019t mean they vote for Trump.  I mean they love him.  How would DeSantis insulting Trump have helped him?",
            "Not. I believe the far right push to have government control every facet of our lives from women\u2019s medical decisions, to book banning, book burnings, voter restrictions, elimination of entire departments of the federal government, to demanding no one say the words climate and change together, particularly with recent meteorological events this over reach will be their down fall this November and for some elections to come. We will NOT become their faux theocracy so they can usher in their brand of fascism.",
            "There was a window of time post Jan 6 where the Republican Party was open to a new leader. And no one has the guts to step up, so they got Trump again.",
            "Impossible because anti wokeness is the one thing DeSantis and Trump agreed on.  Not a differentiator. \n\nNotice DeSantis sunk because the polling emphatically showed that the public thinks \u201cbeing woke\u201d is good. That\u2019s also why Trump dropped it as a campaign strategy.",
            "You can't be a loser and campaign on the idea that the other guy is a loser.\n\nDeSantis has absolutely no game. He is anti-charisma. He is the Republican equivalent of Hillary Clinton in that he absolutely cannot relate to or communicate with people that are not of his own type.\n\nTrying to dethrone Trump by calling Trump a looser means you need to not be the kind of guy who wears platform shoes on the regular.",
            "He lost for two reasons he doesn't know how to be a human being and those white boots during the hurricane",
            "The whole woke thing was weird too. It\u2019s just a childish sounding word that made him seem like he was whining all the time. the fact that he centered his whole campaign on it is crazy. he basically marched around the country in his ridiculous boots getting triggered at everything",
            "I don\u2019t know how much better he\u2019d have done but he damn sure couldn\u2019t have done worse.",
            "I think if all the GOP would have focused their efforts that way it would have been a piece of cake. Get FOX news on board and no problem. They didn\u2019t have the guts to do it so they get what they deserve.",
            "I know a half a dozen people who would have followed that narrative and voted for descant is in the general",
            "Pretty much the same.\n\n\nHave you heard him speak?\u00a0 I'd expect Jeb! to bully him.",
            "Not very.\n\nDeSantis lacks Charisma, a basic aspect of being a national politician.\n\nHe was mooching off Trump's Charisma. Thus he could not run against him.",
            "It wouldn't have mattered. Trump-or-nothing is still the choice of the GOP organization & enough of the base voters that they would have written him in if he wasn't on the ballot. If anything, DeSantis dropping out gives the GOP a better shot in November since he won't be there to split the vote. \n\nAnd as has been proven repeatedly over time, all the \"never Trumpers\" who claim they won't vote for him really will vote for him.",
            "DeSantis was a bad candidate, in my opinion. His promise to \u201cmake America Florida\u201d isn\u2019t that appealing, especially since the country already views Florida as the \u201cradical weirdo\u2019 state. DeSantis was very awkward on the campaign trail, spent too much too early on a fancy campaign bus to visit all 50 states with. He sucks at fundraising, and doesn\u2019t seem to get much support from his own party. On top of that, he\u2019s too dependent on Trump\u2019s policies. Why vote for a radical weirdo, when you could just vote for an established politician with the same beliefs? DeSantis isn\u2019t unique enough to distinguish himself from the rest of his party. Outside of his total social ineptitude, perhaps.",
            "He doesn\u2019t have a personality. Most people don\u2019t like him. He is unemployable outside of Florida.",
            "Another \"if\" question. If Elizabeth had balls, she'da been King! We should judge these guys on what they do, not what they say. The \"if\" is for us. If you like Florida under DeSantis, then by all means vote for him. Please don't try to rehabilitate him with \"ifs\".",
            "The more voters see of DeSantis the less they like him.  It wouldn't matter what his message was, he just is a terrible candidate.",
            "DeSantis was always a weirdo largely propped up by the media. He wouldn't have made it regardless of the strategy used.",
            "The first time he tried to smile was a tell of how bad a candidate he is.  Also screaming at the kids with masks. Who does that?",
            "Equally terribly. DeSantis had a pretty solid niche cut out for himself - he was a Trump alternative who would attract the party\u2019s right wing with a much more conservative legislative record. The problem is, he\u2019s also an incredibly off-putting person. Trumpism is also a cult of personality to an extent; he knows how to work a crowd and look comfortable on camera. DeSantis does not",
            "The Republican Party is now the MAGA party and Trump is the head of the party.  He will be the head of the party even if he loses.  Conservative republicans that argue that point are just shouting into the wind.",
            "Republican cowards too afraid to rile the troglodytes to even say the truth out loud. Spineless, money-and-power-chasing cowards",
            "I don't think there's a significant portion of the GOP base that's both appealed to by Trumpesque insults and amenable to being dissuaded from voting for Trump. The voters who'd consider \"my opponent is a loser\" to be persuasive rhetoric hitched themselves to the Trump train 8 years ago, and those who didn't would find it uncouth.",
            "He has a decent chance at success in the future though lately people will say they want a young candidate but seem to vote for prior experience in government the most",
            "DeSantis has the charismatic authority of a bicycle tire. His future is zero once he's term limited out of governor.",
            "Politicians should have a positive message about what they intend to accomplish rather than a negative message about their opponent(s).  This is what is wrong with American elections.  People want to vote FOR a candidate rather than AGAINST the alternative.",
            "Maybe Nikki Haley\u2019s numbers, but that would take some measure of integrity which he doesn\u2019t have. Nor Haley who recently whored herself out by ass-kissed Trump with her endorsement. Had the two of them, Pence, Christie and Asa Hutchinson banded together it may have made a difference, but probably not. The white entitlement roots of the GOP is so engrained nothing would stop Trump from the nomination. The fundamental question  facing America is what kind of nation is it? Vote and we\u2019ll see.",
            "Donald Trump is the most popular president to ever breathe. Nearly Every Republican that has ever critisized him has returned to being a loyalist. \n\nThe Republicans will never not nominate Trump. And once Trump dies, someone in his family is going to take over.",
            "I feel sometimes people forget just how powerful charisma is in with national politics.  Bill Clinton, George W Bush, Barack Obama, these three American politicians had a natural charismatic vibe that pulled in voters and drew peoples attention.  This is not to say every American liked them, nor am I going on about their policies, but rather those three men had ways of talking to people, getting their attention and vote that desantis could never reach.\n\nWhen we look at trump, he himself is a showman, an entertainer, he knows how to get people to cheer and rave for him.  I believe if we were to get a one on one debate between trump and desantis, with a crowd, trump would walk all over desantis and there is nothing desantis could do to fight that. He doesn't know how to connect to the people, he doesn't know how to make you feel like he is one of us, common folk.",
            "This. I wonder how many of that 30% had listened to him talk.",
            "If we\u2019re still doing elections in 10 years, the fact that every Republican politician under the age of 50 was the smarmy kid who wore a suit to school and reminded the teacher when they forgot to assign homework is going to be a real limiting factor",
            "He was too much of a weirdo and freak for Republican primary voters as his social skills just prove that, and then he would have been too far to the right socially for general election voters.\n\nHe would have lost easily in a general election against any Democratic candidate had he (somehow) won the primary. His far-right social policies would have been a turn-off for most voters and he wouldn't drive turnout from the right like Trump may do (and only Trump can). In fact, him signing that 6-week abortion ban pretty much ended any chance he could win a nationwide general election ever.",
            "I've never disagreed with a reddit post more in my life tbh. Nikki Haley only seemed like a viable candidate to five or six billionaire gop donors and democrats. You had a better chance than her of winning the Republican nomination.\n\nHad trump not run, desantis would have steamrolled the other candidates. There was genuine enthusiasm for him prior to the primary and his combative tone fits today's gop\n\nBut this is trump's party and no one else had a snowball's chance in the sun's core. Especially now that trump is perceived to be under attack by democratic prosecutors.",
            "How do you figure Haley would've won?   She never beat DeSantis before he suspended his campaign",
            "Also \"Make America Florida\" was never going to fly on the national stage. DeSantis only looks successful in Florida because he surrounds himself with yes-men and friendly press.",
            "Sounds like you described Trump \ud83e\udd14: \n\u201aDeSantis simply does not have the people skills or relatability to succeed as a presidential nominee. He has no charisma whatsoever and comes off as extremely awkward. He struggles with public events and interacting with people in general. He gets thrashed in debates and frequently looks like a fool.\u2018",
            "I\u2019ve met with DeSantis twice, and he is just so awkward. He can\u2019t talk to people well, but he is a damn effective governor.",
            "Oh yeah. Rick Perry for sure. Good call.",
            "He's as charismatic as an unhinged door. He makes Nixon look like Obama. So I agree he wouldn't have won even if he pursued a different tactic. \n\nHowever, once it was clear he was going no where, he could have changed gears and gone after Trump. He would have stood a better chance. Note Haley was the one that consolidated the anti-Trump vote, and she made some pretty dumb errors at critical moments. \n\nAt the same time, DeSantis wants to run again, so politically it made no sense for him to go strong after Trump. All he needs now is a personality transplant, and he should be good to go for 2028.",
            "Jeb Bush or Ron DeSantis?",
            "I would have said Scott Walker.  Similar vibe of a \"successful\" Republican governor who just didn't have the abilities to compete in bigger leagues.\n\nAnd now, without looking it up, you can't be 100% sure he's even still alive.",

Well that's who votes for Republicans so you're with us.\"\n\n\"Oh well gee whiz I am all that stuff so I guess I'll vote for Republicans and I guess I hate Democrats now, hyuk hyuk hyuk\"",
            "The Jeb comparison is interesting because Jeb also governed the same state that DeSantis currently governs. \n\nSo the question now becomes, what is it about Republican governors of Florida that they flop on a national state? Is there some sort of Florida appeal that doesn\u2019t work on the big stage?",
            "I'm not sure that's a fair comparison, given the actual context of the \"please clap\" moment. He'd repeatedly had to shush an overly enthusiastic crowd in the middle of his speech, and was telling them he was done speaking and they were allowed to applaud.",

There is an alternate world where he campaigns on Trump being a loser and on a 15 a week ban, and he wins the nomination.\n\nYeah. Him signing that 6 week abortion ban as Governor sunk any chance he could ever win a nationwide general election.",
            ">  Instead he wanted their votes and he was always gonna come in second.\n\nI honestly can't believe this was his campaign's strategy. Had Trump actually been done with politics, this *might* have been a viable strategy. His campaign seems to have catastrophically misread the situation and his fundamental pitch was: \"Trump is the best thing since sliced bread and that's why you should vote for me instead of him.\" It's incredible that nobody in that campaign with enough influence recognized how stupid of a pitch it was. At least Haley was trying to rally the voters that were over Trump, but even she couldn't bring herself to actually mount any significant attacks on Trump. What a bunch of morons.",
            "Yet he won reelection in FL by how much?",
            "That 6 week abortion ban he signed would have sunk him in a general",

            "> In fact, him signing that 6-week abortion ban pretty much ended any chance he could win a nationwide general election ever.\n\nYeah.  Something Trump is weirdly good at is taking multiple positions on the same issue and somehow people who are inclined to support him convince themselves that the one they like is what he *really* believes.\n\nDeSantis doesn't have that skill, and it's already a lot harder to spin something you personally signed into law recently.  That pins you down in a way someone who isn't currently in office as they're running never will be.",
            "I agree with most of this, except I don't think there's any world in which it would have been DeSantis.  Had Trump not run, someone else would have run that sat this year out because they knew they wouldn't beat Trump and would be damaged in the try.\n\nDeSantis is exactly the kind of politician who does really well in a small market in which he can control his messaging and appearances very strongly (and, to be fair, this is a useful political skill and DeSantis is good at it).  But that was never going to stand up on the national stage as long as any nearly other conservative-branded white man was available.  \n\n(Coincidentally this is also the bar that Haley would have had to clear, which is why I agree with you that she never had a chance.)",
            ">There was genuine enthusiasm for him prior to the primary\n\nI mean, there was enthusiasm *about* him and his record in Florida. But whenever the guy gets in front of the camera he just comes off as so lame. He is a charisma black hole. \n\nCompare two different reactions to a similar situation. This really happened. Both Trump and DeSantis are giving a speech when protestors come in and start making a ruckus. Trump says something to the effect of \"let em up here I'll deal with em\" as he does some goofy shadow boxing. The crowd eats it up.\n\nAt Desantis' event, as the protestors are getting escorted out he says: \"hnee he wow you guys just wasted your $15 on tickets \ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\". Pretty much silence from the crowd.\n\nThe guy had a strong following on paper and off camera. More than two minutes at a time with a camera on him and he was concentrated cringe. Every single time.

            "I'm of two minds about it. I'll sometimes see Trump say something and think \"God, what a fascist!\" But I don't think this is genuine old-school 1930s fascism. I think it's something... else. It's even weirder than that.\n\nFor example, you'll hear liberals say that Trump will destroy the system, and that's we have to vote to stop him. There are some people who vote for Trump because they think he will! But actually, I think he'll do what he did last time: appoint more arch-conservative judges -- who will be there for many years after him -- while posting on Truth Social and eating hamburgers and derailing policy meetings with his advisors by going on 45-minute tangents about hot babes on private planes.\n\nThat just isn't Nazi Germany, which I do think really tried to mobilize Germans and create the sense that they were living in a \"great age.\" In MAGA, I see a nihilistic and atomized society run by people who seek to fuel mutual distrust and deep indifference. The idea is to make people passive, not mass mobilization like in a totalitarian regime. The only thing that matters is making money and avoiding how to be ripped off by other people.\u00a0The actual result is cynicism, fatalism, and apathy. A bit like Putin's Russia.\n\nBut it's for this reason they need some \"excess\" to make it \"work.\" They have to dress themselves up to create the image that what they're doing is some great drama. There's a movie called Iron Sky, which is a satirical movie about a Nazi invasion from the moon (complete with flying saucers), and there's one scene where Sarah Palin (who is the president) needs to juice her poll numbers so she [hires some Nazis](https://youtu.be/C-VglGOKR3E?si=lCHN2bwxTl4JW7L6) as contractors to write speeches for her -- this turns out to be popular.

Even if the campaign defense is true that Trump didn't personally approve of the message, the fact that he attracts the kind of people who find the message of a \"unified reich\" compelling is by itself concerning. The dog whistle has been there for decades, but now it's becoming louder to the humans.\n\n>Do you think there is a genuine old school 1930s-era fascist threat from Trump and his associates?\n\nI think that's the wrong framing. The thing about fascism is that it's ideologically slippery and forms to fit into whatever the current context is. I don't, for example, think that Donald Trump is going to lean into eugenics, which was a much more popular pseudoscience in the 30s, talk about purifying the white race ([though there are plenty in his orbit who do talk like that](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gop-leaders-denounce-greene-gosar-speaking-white-nationalist-event-rcna18050)), and start a bunch of death camps.\n\nWhat we do know is that Trump taps into a lot of popular outrage and has a very authoritarian bent. He cares not for norms and laws, except how they might be exploited for his own power. We've had 4 years of him being in office to see that explicitly, as well as the last 3 1/2 years of him continuing to use bad faith rhetoric and actions to exploit the systems trying to hold him accountable for his laundry list of wrongdoing, both in and out of office. At the very least, the attempted self-coup to subvert the 2020 election and remain in office demonstrate a minimum threshold for how far Donald Trump is willing to go to arrogate power to himself at the expense of the Republic which he seeks office under. For that reason alone, the prospect of a second Trump presidency should be incredibly concerning for anyone who cares about the continued stability and legitimacy of the United States.\n\nBeyond the doomsday scenario of a President-made-King (which does echo what Hitler and Mussolini did in the 1930s, when they leveraged parliamentary office into becoming dictators with indefinite tenure), what might a 2025 Trump Administration look like? For a start, we can expect him to continue along the same paths that he went down starting in 2017. We can expect the Federal government to corruptly hand out key administration posts to captains of industry with the intent to deregulate those industries for private profit. Expect the EPA to cast a blind eye to polluters. Expect a rollback of greenhouse gas controls. As an extension to that, expect foreign affairs to once again be an out-and-out exercise in wielding diplomatic power for private profit and personal gain. We saw Trump try to leverage Ukraine's relationship with the US to neuter a political opponent, which led to his first impeachment, as an example.\n\nExpect a second-term Trump to continue trying to subvert the professional civil service to bend it to his political and personal will. We saw the first attempts at that late in his first term with the attempted implementation of Schedule F, which would have turned any career employee who has any say in Federal policy turned into an at-will excepted service employee subject to the President's dismissal without due process. Rather than a civil service dedicated to the Republic and executing the rule of law (*all* laws, not just the President's orders) and the nuanced technicalities of the field they administer, you'll have an army of bureaucrats responsive to the President and the President alone.\n\nWe saw cruelty and theatrics at the border in Trump's first term, and I would expect more of the same, perhaps ramped up. Expect a slowdown or complete halting of processing of asylum and humanitarian claims, especially if they come from less wealthy or less white countries of origin, just like when Trump instituted the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy and canceled a Federal program allowing refugees from Haiti to continue remaining in the US. Expect a reinstitution of the \"zero tolerance\" illegal border crossing policy that resulted in screaming children being ripped from their mother's arms simply because the mother committed a misdemeanor criminal offense. Expect those children to be abused by a careless bureaucracy, including being kept in inhumane detention facilities. Expect a not insignificant number of those children to be repatriated back to a dangerous country in a dangerous situation, or alternatively to be fostered in the US without care given to whether they are being placed with a safe family who will care for them. Expect those children to be lost to their families forever, either through trafficking, abuse, or lost records. Going a step beyond what Trump I did, expect Trump II to build camps (perhaps rephrased to a more placid sounding \"emergency detention facilities\" or some such term) for any and all suspected or confirmed illegal aliens. Expect lawful asylum seekers who do make it through the border to be sent to these camps, rather than released on their own recognizance while waiting for an immigration hearing. Expect ICE to be involved, but also expect state and local law enforcement to be deputized by ICE and given free rein to detain anyone within their jurisdictions that they suspect to be in the United States unlawfully. Expect those detainees to be given no legal recourse, even if their suspected immigration status was in error. Expect the conditions in those facilities to be inhumane, and expect them to be built with emergency funds on corrupt contracts funneled to Trump's boosters and family.\n\nI live in Portland and saw firsthand the Trump administration's response to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. Over the wishes both the state and the city, Trump sent various DHS units to Portland to \"protect the Federal courthouse and other Federal offices in downtown Portland.\" These officers in unmarked cars and displaying no markings identifying them as law enforcement abducted isolated citizens not engaged in any criminal conduct or imminently threatening Federal facilities off the streets. We're lucky that no one was shot on either end of those interactions. We also saw heavy-handed Federal police tactics in other cities and at other times, such as when Trump cleared Lafayette Square so that he could have a photo opp (hint: the point of the activity was not the photo, it was the demonstration of power against liberal protestors for his base of supporters). In 2025, I expect to see mass protests all over the country if Trump is inaugurated, and I expect Trump escalate his previous tactics to quickly invoke the Insurrection Act, quickly deploy available military units, including the National Guard, and impose some kind of martial law and occupation on \"lawless Democratic cities.\" I hesitate to speculate on what happens after that, but I can't imagine anything good.\n\nThose are just the things off the top of my head. Does that resemble in 1930s fascism? In some ways, sure, but not in other ways. Are we going to have roaming bands of brownshirts and blackshirts? Probably not (though I imagine the Proud Boys and Oathkeepers might make some noise in isolated cases). Will we see concentration camps to detain and segregate \"others?\" I would bet on it, especially in the immigration realm. Will we see a more authoritarian Federal government, with various liberal institutions being eroded or outright dismantled? That's a 100% guarantee.\n\nFinally, I'd like to point out that the Heritage Foundation has put together a combination wish list, road map, and detailed plan for imposing a conservative policy agenda on the country, called [Project 2025](https://www.project2025.org/) ([associated Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025#Policies)). While the Heritage Foundation has been publishing these \"Mandates for Leadership\" for 40 years, Project 2025 stands out for its ambition and desire to entirely overhaul effectively every part of the Federal Government. It was heavily influenced by the lessons learned in the first Trump administration and, while written in a way that was technically generic, has a second Trump term, or at least a Trump-like term, specifically in mind. A President Trump would by no means be *required* to hew to what's in Project 2025, I expect there to be relatively little deviation from it. Go ahead and skim through it. If you're not a fan of fascism in general, it should scare the bejeezus out of you.",
            "Yesterday I misunderstood the source of that 'unified reich' text that appeared in the video. I assumed it was an article from somewhere (which really would be just as bad but I digress) that the employee copied and pasted into the video without really paying attention.\n\nBut nope! Someone hired by the trump team was given specific instructions on making a video, and what they did to follow the instructions was to generate it from scratch, to type the words \"unified reich\" and to make it look like a headline and compose the image to look like a newspaper. \n\nWhatever their instructions were these words were absolutely used intentionally.",
            "when Trump was elected in 2016, I thought that some of his wording, behavior, etc. seemed pretty clearly textbook  statist would-be violent ruler.\n\nIn 2020 what I told my Jewish family and friends was that we didn't have that many jobs coming out of Hebrew School, but that \"not voting for the next Hitler\" and speaking out against him was pretty clearly one of them, and that  those who vote for Trump did not apparently take that \"never again\" stuff very seriously.  The one thing I was grateful for was that Trump made his Constitution-wrecking intentions pretty obvious from the start (in my opinion).  \n\n[edited]\nI was always worried that if the moment of truth came for me as a voter, where I had to stand up against a threat to the Rule of Law, I would not be entirely sure whom to oppose and whom to support.  But in the case of the 2016, 2020 and 2024 elections, the matter is quite clear to me.  As uncomfortable as I may be with Biden's garden variety socialism, in my view one must vote for Biden as a stop-gap against Trump and his fascist goals.  If Trump is re-elected, or if he succeeds in his plan to not heed the vote, then the Constitution as we know it is over.  Trump has made that crystal clear.  If my fellow Americans who are Republicans and subscribe to Republican values and platform positions wanted me to consider voting for the Republican, then they should have nominated someone who is not transparently seeking the end of the Rule of Law.\n\n  \nA book that has helped me through all of this is called \"The Ominous Parallels\".    It was published in the early 80s by an associate of Ayn Rand named Leonard Peikoff and (whether you like her philosophy or dislike it) does an eerily excellent job of laying out pre-WWII Germany, 1970s US, and the parallels between the two.  This is the book that did the most to help me recognize the language of right-wing statism coming out of Trump's mouth, and (critically) out of the mouths of his supporters in the media.  I wonder if Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Beck et. al. understand the extent of their contributions to Mr. Trump's efforts to undermine the rule of Law.   Ironically the author of the Ominous Parallels himself tragically voiced support for voting for Trump in 2020.  It's not as though he didn't warn us in his book that in a situation where there is plenty of intellectual bankruptcy to go around, particularly bankruptcy in our most fundamental philosophic thinking, that a dictator could arise and come to power.  It has made some sense to me that otherwise rational highly intelligent people would seem to shock us by falling into the trap of allowing Biden to be so demonized that they will vote for anyone against him, but I can't help but say it is terribly disappointing that this happened to Peikoff.",

That will be announced in 2 weeks after the jury results of the NYC trial are announced.   Nikki is first required to denounce the judge and prosecutor in the case that results in his guilty verdict.\n\nTrump took advantage of Haley, since he knew she is so ambitious that she would sell her soul to be VP, even after Trump insulted her, her husband, her family, and her voters.

Why argue about specific issues at the point of a gun, or when the rule of law is being threatened?    \n  \nTrump seems to be completely committed to destroying the US voting system (naturally under guise of being concerned about the \"fairness\" of the vote).

Another thing I've noticed all these years, which is probably also taken from the would-be fascist dictator playbook, is the extraordinary vilification of Trump's opponents.  Both Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden have received this treatment.  As long as they can be made out to be so evil that nobody should vote for them, then Trump can be the recipient of more votes.

            "**Title: Exploring Parallels: Trump, Project 2025, and Historical Comparisons**\n\n**Introduction:**\nIn contemporary political discourse, comparisons between historical events and present-day movements often prompt intense debates. One such comparison gaining attention is the perceived resemblance between Trump's administration, Project 2025, and the Republican Party with elements of Hitler's Nazi Party. This analysis aims to delve into these comparisons objectively, examining ideologies, policies, and societal impacts to evaluate their validity and implications for the future.\n\n**Consolidation of Power:**\n*Historical Context:*\nThe failed Beer Hall Putsch and Hitler's subsequent rise to Chancellorship in Germany are notable historical events showcasing power consolidation by the Nazi Party.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nDrawing parallels, Project 2025, initiated by The Heritage Foundation, aims to establish a comprehensive conservative agenda. Comparisons have been made between Trump's leadership style and Hitler's consolidation of power, raising concerns about civil rights protections and government restructuring.\n\n**Civil Rights and Contraception Ban:**\n*Historical Context:*\nUnder Hitler, strict gender roles and contraception bans were enforced, reflecting authoritarian control over societal norms.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nSimilarly, Project 2025 proposes control over body autonomy and contraception, emphasizing traditional family dynamics and religious ideologies, raising concerns about gender equality and discrimination protections.\n\n**Religious Nationalism:**\n*Historical Context:*\nHitler's use of Christianity to justify extremist views and policies is a historical precedent showcasing religious nationalism in politics.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nProject 2025 advocates for infusing government with Christian elements, promoting traditional roles and restricting reproductive rights, echoing historical rhetoric used to justify authoritarian measures.\n\n**The Pillars:**\n*Historical Context:*\nThe Third Reich's pillars included backlash against societal changes, anti-communism, nationalism, and resentment post-World War I.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nProject 2025's pillars reflect a consensus view on governance, personnel database management, education, and transition planning, raising concerns about authoritarian tendencies and suppression of dissent.\n\n**A New Police State:**\n*Historical Context:*\nThe Gestapo's brutal tactics and the SS's paramilitary control exemplify historical police state measures under the Third Reich.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nConcerns about Project 2025 leading to a police state in the U.S. are raised, reflecting fears of authoritarian control and suppression of freedoms.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis of Project 2025 reveals parallels to historical events that led to totalitarian regimes. While comparisons provide insights, it's crucial to approach these discussions with objectivity and respect for differing perspectives. By understanding these parallels, we can advocate for democratic values and human rights to prevent erosion of freedoms in modern politics.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://michiganadvance.com/2024/01/16/project-2025-if-allowed-will-cement-america-as-a-rightwing-authoritarian-state/\n\nhttps://www.project2025.org/playbook/\n\nhttps://ghdi.ghi-dc.org/sub_image.cfm?image_id=2048\n\nhttps://www.project2025.org/\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinder,_K%C3%BCche,_Kirche\n\nhttps://msmagazine.com/2024/02/08/project-2025-conservative-right-wing-trump-woke/\n\nhttps://www.dailysignal.com/2023/04/20/4-pillars-project-2025-conservative-plan-undermine-liberal-behemoth-washington/amp/\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Nazi-belts-have-God-with-us-engraved\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/26/what-is-project-2025-trump\n\nhttps://www.heritage.org/press/project-2025-continues-grow-60-partners-preparing-next-presidential-administration\n\nhttps://www.project2025.org/policy/\n\nhttps://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/03/donald-trump-hitler-similarities\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/trump-social-media-account-video-unified-reich/\n\nhttps://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2024/03/13/trump-hitler-putin-kim-jong-un-john-kelly\n\nhttps://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4677700-trumps-latest-flirtation-with-nazi-symbolism-draws-criticism/",
            "Project 2025 is the American version of Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf. Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers Party aka the Nazi Party. The Beer Hall Putsch in 1923, Hitler and his SA \u201cbrown shirts\u201d have made themselves known, and as a result he was thrown in prison where he wrote the book Mein Kampf\u2026outlining all of the plans to consolidate power to the Nazi Party and to Hitler himself by force and violence, to dismantle and abolish the Weimar Republic, and to remove protections of discrimination of certain groups Hitler deemed inferior (Jews, Gypsies, Communists, Bolsheviks, Homosexuals, people with physical and mental disabilitie, and many more), and exterminate them from his Reich. Also for women, body autonomy and abortion was verboten (forbidden)\u2026as Hitler believed that women\u2019s primary roles in Nazi Germany was to the children, kitchen, and church, and that women are to have a bunch of offspring so to purify his Aryan Master Race, for soldiers to fight for Germany, and for wives and mothers to become mere baby factories. Also regarding the Christian nationalism as stated in Project 2025\u2026Hitler also mentions a very interesting similar view when it came to Christianity in Nazi Germany. Hitler has put in that book that he himself believes he is doing the will of God regarding his Nazi ideology more than once. Then people started reading Mein Kampf and it soon became the Bible of Nazi Germany and led to Hitler becoming Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and the Final Solution to be put into work, leading extreme discrimination, torture, and systematically murdering millions in concentration camps\u2026while those who survived were scarred forever living in Hell, and ultimately the Second World War. All because of ONE MAN and his book \u201cMein Kampf\u201d, or to be more specific based on current events,Project 1933. Mein Kampf Project 1933 was not just his autobiography, but a very detailed plan of establishing a fascist mass genocidal dictatorship\u2026which very suspiciously and coincidently \u00a0strongly parallels the modern Project 2025, also involving forceful consolidation of power to the Republican Party, the Executive Branch, and the Republican President; the dismantling of the government, the removal of protections against discrimination of LGBTQ, People of Color, Women, Jews, Muslims, Immigrants, and many more, and the Christian nationalism that Hitler and the Nazi Party enforced with brutality, violence, and murder. Project 2025 is the American version of Mein Kampf also known as Project 1933.\u00a0",

Lawmakers and advocates across both political parties supported the bill as a necessary step to address some of the punitive excesses of the 1980s and 1990s.1\n\nThe First Step Act includes a range of sentencing reforms which made the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 retroactive,2enhanced judicial discretion, created earned time credits, increased good time credits, reduced certain mandatory minimum sentences, and expanded the safety valve that allows persons with minor prior convictions to serve less time than previously mandated.\n\nThe First Step Act also seeks to expand opportunities for people in federal prisons to participate in rehabilitative programming to support their success after release. The law aims to produce lower odds of recidivism by incentivizing incarcerated individuals to engage in rigorous, evidence-based rehabilitation and education programming. In exchange and based on a favorable assessment of risk to the community, they may earn an earlier opportunity for release to community corrections.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDoesn\u2019t sound fascist to me!",

Hitler legitimately had aspirations to make Germany the world's most powerful nation, and to transform it into an empire. Trump ultimately does not care about making America a stronger nation or more respected on the world stage (as evidenced by his actions), he cares about acquiring those things *for himself*.\n\nHe doesn't care about using the role of Commander in Chief of the world's most powerful military to advance America's goals worldwide -he cares about using it to make *he himself* the singular most powerful man on the planet.\n\nHe doesn't care about using the platform / bully pulpit of the US Presidency to inspire, lead, and shape the values of its people - he cares about all the attention and respect it garners *him*. \n\nHe doesn't care about POTUS' status as the \"final arbiter\" of what legislation becomes legally binding in America - he cares about how it makes people vie for *his* approval and grovel for *his* permission. \n\nHe doesn't care about the Executive's ability to nominate judges who will enforce the nation's laws fairly, equally, and without bias - he cares about being able to use it to essentially make *himself* immune to any and all consequences. \n\nThe man is *entirely* ego. It's why the GOP has continually found him so hard to quit - he truly has no guiding ideological compass or principles, and will sign or do anything that feeds his insatiable hunger for attention, power, and respect. He's a blank check for whatever policy preferences you want to advance, so long as you satisfy those conditions. \n\nMost fascist dictators throughout history have held the obsession with power, control, and violence because they believed they alone had the vision necessary to transform their nation into the shape they desired - and they needed that power and control to do so. Donald Trump's obsession with power, control, and violence instead stems from a pathological need to feed his ego - to *feel* powerful; to *feel* a sense of control over other people. \n\nIn other words - IMO - Trump's obsessions with all the aspects of fascism don't stem from a desire to wield them to transform the nation in his image, they stem from a *need* to use them to feed his all-devouring ego.",

That is how he builds his brand. But, like, Dugin proposes to depopulate Russian cities because they're breeding grounds for \"degeneration, alienation and madness.\" He sounds like Pol Pot. Which is not something I think the Russian government believes in. You'll also see him come in for broadside attacks in Moskovsky Komsomlets, which is a major newspaper, so he's clearly not an untouchable figure in Russia.\n\nDugin also tries to interface with political extremists outside of Russia. They are 100% weirdos. He has done this with neo-Nazis in the United States, and also a Brazilian group called Nova Resistencia which espouses a fascist ideology and praises Dugin along with Muammar Gaddafi and Julius Evola.

Yes this rhetoric has a *long* storied history of people justifying some heinous crimes against entire demographics.\n\n>1 - There hasn't been a officially proven lynching since 1981. The KKK only has 8000 members left and have done nothing for decades. The cartels are a active threat today and have 175,000+ members \n\nWhat threat?  Are you as equally concerned about the proliferation of guns, do you worry about irresponsible people with guns shooting random people coming to the door as much as you do cartels in *Mexico*?  What the fucking hell are you on about?\n\n>2 - Litterally nothing I have said suggest I want anyone to be harmed based on skin color alone. I am saying criminal trespassers should be considered a active overall threat to the country until background checked. It's why we don't care about visa overstays because they got vetted already.\n\nGuess what, Cartels have the money and resources to get visas.  What *exactly* are you worried about?

While most Republican voters are with Trump and some Nikki Haley voters will return home, it seems pretty clear that the fracture within the Republican Party is real, and I imagine the Biden campaign thinks they can break the coalition necessary for Trump to win.",

There are very few true undecideds left. \n\nThe Haley voters who are most likely to break for Biden are the conservatives who prefer a principled leader who puts the country first, even when they disagree with those principles.

            "People in the US tend to vote along party lines pretty consistently. Getting someone who would vote for Haley to vote for Biden instead would be easier than convincing someone who wants to vote for Trump, sure, but they are much more likely to be convinced to vote for Trump than Biden.\n\n*If* they vote.\n\nThe thing is, winning in an election in America is usually more about getting your own base to turn out rather than reaching across party lines. It's why MAGA has been so successful despite a large portion of Republicans despising them. Jaded Republicans don't vote Democrat instead of MAGA, they just don't vote at all. However MAGA Republicans have a consistently high turn out, so it doesn't matter.\n\nSimilarly, it's why Biden won despite how incredibly unenthusiastic Dems were about him. People just hated Trump so fucking much that they would have voted for a particularly ornery Chimpanzee over him.\n\nSay what you will about Trump, but he's a master at getting people to get up and vote. He's probably driven more voter turnout for Democrats than any Democrat in living memory.\n\nAnyway, the point I'm getting at is: if I were running Biden's campaign, I wouldn't be trying to get never-trumper Republicans to vote for me. I'd be trying to get them to stay home.\n\nThe major advantage to presenting yourself as the reasonable, boring, status quo option, is that it doesn't invoke urgency in the hearts of your opponent's constituents. Notice that the Trump Campaign is struggling to find angles on Biden that are as scandalous as \"crooked Hilary\". Biden simply does not evoke the same level of instinctual revulsion in the hearts of mortal men as Hillary Clinton. They can only get as far as making him out to be a Democrat Stooge/puppet with the average level of corruption and love for big government, as opposed to the \"Satanic pedophile cultist\" accusations leveled at Clinton.\n\nIt's like a rap battle. Sometimes, when someone is coming at you all hard and heavy, just eating you alive with the crowd behind them, the solution is to lean back and treat them like the weirdo they are to take the wind out of their sails.\n\nAll Biden has to do to take advantage of the Nikki Haley voters is to be boring enough he doesn't live rent free in their heads 24/7. Boring enough that they let life get in the way and forget to ask Todd to cover for them so they can dip out of the office early.",

            "The answer to US immigration is that not all states should have the same policy. Canada has one of the most lax immigration policies, why? because they need people to come there. It's not a very large nation and is a difficult region to live in. Rather than just send people illegally immigrating back, they should be given an open to go to a state with a generous immigration policy and apply for citizenship. There's states in the middle of the country or a state like alaska that could use more people living there. That have an aging population that could use immigrants coming in to fill jobs. I think this is a large part of why New York has been flipping red. They need economic migrants.

They could have capitalized on the youth vote if they had actually done ground work after the 2020 election to keep those kids motivated but instead they wasted time capitulating to manchin and Sinema to barely get a fraction of the agenda passed. They suck at messaging because they just assume people will vote their way because the other guy is crazy\u2026.but when Youngkin won gov of Virginia that should have been their big red flag/signal to get to work on their ground game. He was successful in distancing himself from Trump and was able to lock in moderate voters\u2026.there are tons of youth voters who voted in 2020 and they were all geared up and ready to ride for Biden or whoever blue no matter who whatever person but with these terrible decisions from Biden and his actions with Israel and the same bs law and order speech he gave about the overwhelmingly peaceful pro Palestine protests it\u2019s just misstep after misstep so the only people they are left with are the fash adjacent weirdos who would welcome fascism on a silver platter.

Most use algorithms or location settings to tailor the type of news one sees to ensure maximum engagement. This isn't 1984. Joe Biden or Donald Trump can't reach everyone through a Times Magazine interview. Reaching voters in 2024 means hoarding attention. Not speaking directly to a singular group. \n\nThe way to be everywhere isn't to go everywhere. Rather the way to be everywhere is to make everyone come to you. That is why Trump does so well. Trump's unhinged and often shocking behavior is tailor made to suck in attention. To appeal to Nikki Haley voters Joe Biden needs to first get attention.\n\nI suspect Nikki Haley voters are moderates who care about foreign policy, education, and spending. As such Nikki Haley voters are probably watching the Campus protests closely. Biden should find a way (safe and non disruptive) to visit one of the schools and engage with students and faculty. People would tune in for that. No one is paying attention to pop up ads, Sunday morning interviews, and late night shows.",
            "Nikki Haley voters should vote for Biden, she has already stated what many of us know about the damage and danger of Trump.    Anyone voting for Trump damages America, Damages our Judicial System, Damages our Political System and Damages the American General Society of Citizens.\n\nWhat he has done to damage our Judicial System and those who enable him have no ideal that America will have a difficult time prosecuting foreign actors who damage American, because they see the mess people like Judge Cannon is making when it comes to America's Top Secret Document and Higher Classification of Documents with her purposeful delays. We see damage to the Election Process which much damages has been done over the past years that Trump has been in the political arena.\n\nWe see the social, civic and civil damages that is done by Trump's obsessive promotions of political divisiveness in people and in congress.    Republican congress can't get any work for the nation and people done, because they keep fighting Trump's and Republican Culture War Idiocy Games.  We lived through 4 years of Trump playing musical chairs with Cabinet Position Seats, We saw him cozy up to Tyrants and Dictators and insult our Intelligence Agencies and our Military Persons and our Military Forces.    The list is far too long to type here.\n\nWe've seen the disaster of a mess he crated with fleecing banks, fleecing the IRS and then lying when he is confronted with prosecution for his long history of crimes.\n\nWe've seen him delude the followers to think he is \"America', and they ignore that America was here long before Trump and will exist long after Trump is dead and gone.\n\nBiden's work is for America, for American people, and American systems to meet the principles and values laid out in The Preamble.   Biden does not create chaos of divisiveness, and he is working for All Americans.   Biden does not promote culture war idiocy, and he is not trying to mix Religion with National Politics, he support Separation of Church and State.     Biden does not try to make any religion more important to the nation than any other of the many religions that exist in America.\n\nWe've seen many from the Trump network prosecuted and imprisoned, and others who left the Trump administration tell the American people who much of a disaster the Trump Presidency was and how little he knows about International and Domestic Affairs' and how little he knows of America's Political History.    We saw the election interference, the attempted Coup D'etat and the promotion for his followers to Chant and Pursue Mike Pence to hang him.    We've seen Trump continually fleece his followers with clownish MAGA garb, and desecration of the America Flag with MAGA messages painted on Flags, to Trump people wearing the flag as clothing, which is a violation of National Flag Etiquette.\n\nWe watched him destroy the RNC with his daughter in law placed in charge and try to turn the RNC into his own personal Monarchy.    We see Republican politicians submit through fear to Trump and fear of his MAGA followers until they can't do their job and have failed to represent America and America's Principles and Values. Their duty has been focused on providing protective cover for Trump's long list of malice and madness.\n\nHaley voters, know all this, which is why they chose to support Haley over Trump.    \n\nTherefore, **Not a Single Haley Supporter should ever submit to Trump**, their best chance to support American Democracy is to Support Biden.",

The politico article, credit to it, does connect the dots to DiGenova and Toensing, who aren't named in the affidavit.\n\nThis was a couple months after [Joe and Victoria were lobbing Barr to drop the extradition request (he refused)](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/us/giuliani-ukraine-oligarchs.html) which itself came not too long after a meeting between Joe, Lev, Rudy, Dereck Harvey and John Solomon all at \"trump's\" on [May 7th, 2019](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/6660435/Document-Production-Lev-Parnas-January-17-2020.pdf).\n\nWonder what they discussed in that private meeting.\n\nAnd just to be clear how important this plot was to Trump, Lev was [getting a seat next to Trump thanks to his efforts](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6660433-Document-Production-Lev-Parnas-January-17-2020).\n\nTrump these days [denies even knowing the guy's name](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/16/lev-parnas-trump-relationship-100058).\n\nThe story actually gets a lot deeper, and involves a good deal of Ukrainian politics as well.  There's a plot to try to undermine the anti-corruption bureau, NABU, which is related to the firing of Marie Yovanovitch who Lev was also *heavily* involved in.

Like, we could also talk about Hunter Biden's laptop, which also has Rudy Guilaini's fingerprints all over.  Like from day 1.

Many certainly are doing that over I/P, but there's always some level of defection for all sorts of reasons, many of which were also true in 2012.\n\nHillary and Trump were decided not neck and neck at this point in the race. Her lead narrowed only in later September and October, with some ups and downs then. The polls also did not model the electorate well and overestimated her a good bit. They've had two two cycles to correct and it's likely that they have now, or even overcorrect. We will find out in November. Biden has overperformed his primary polls though so that's something.\n\nI honestly don't believe any of the major demographic switches. After Trump and the pandemic, the result in 2020 was Biden doing about 2 points better than Hillary nationally and narrowly winning a few key states. The fundamental situation hasn't changed much. Parts of this group or that will peel off, as always happens. But I'm really skeptical that Biden will go from winning under 30s by 20 points to losing them by 10 (that would be the biggest shift going back to the 60s), especially when that cohort has been voting strong Dem in every election since 2020. So I think the polls have sampling issues and are overcorrecting for 2016/2020. But even if Biden does manage to win, it'll be by a very slim margin. This is not a realignment election.",

Whether the Haley voters are Democratic plants or not, whether they vote for Biden or Trump or someone else in the general, they already at least have reservations about Trump, if not strongly oppose him. If a Republican-leaning voter votes sincerely for Haley in the primary, whether they ultimately go for Trump or not, they know they're not a Democrat. I guess the narrative could communicate to other Republicans that Haley may be a bad candidate, but for those who already voted for Haley they clearly have some skepticism about that. And since it's looking very unlikely Haley will restart her campaign, and certainly won't unless Trump starts suddenly hemorrhaging supporters, it doesn't really matter. I think these voters are practical and most of them will either choose Trump or Biden.\n\nAs for whether these voters are _actually_ plants...I do know someone who in 2016 switched his registration to Republican just to vote against Trump and try to stop him from getting anywhere (while doing volunteer work for the Democrats and voting for Clinton and generally being a solid Democrat--to be clear he voted in the Republican primary on his own, not part of some centralized strategy on the part of Democrats). So I know they do exist...but I don't know how common they are and I think most people don't want to go to that trouble and don't want to register as Republicans when they hate what they stand for, even if doing so is ultimately a good cause.

No amount of coaching is going to fix that.\n\n>Will DeSantis have a role in the Trump administration\n\nHe may find a spot in a 2nd Trump administration, but he won't last long.  DeSantis has a giant ego, and Trump prefers synchophants.\n\n>Will he run for Senate?\n\nMaybe?  He was already in the House of Representatives.  He will likely have competition, though.  I'd say he's just as likely to end up on the board of some defense contractor, or he'll start some kind of grifty legal service like Stephen Miller.",

For Beto is was stating \"Damn right we're going to take your guns\" regardless of how you feel, theres going to be uprising of Republicans to oppose him in whatever office he runs for in Texas.  For Desantis it was the don't say gay bill, the anti-trans stuff has consistently been something that Republicans struggle with, as the more they try to push fringe right social issues legislatively, the more normal people show up to vote them out.  \n\n(This is not me defending Desantis or his policies, simply stating that I see political parallels between two political figures.)",
            "His career is over. What people don\u2019t understand is it wasn\u2019t at all difficult for him to become the king of Florida politics. He was a low profile unknown who ran with trumps endorsement in a red trending state, won, and happened to be governor of the second largest red leaning state during a pandemic. Him refusing to implement strict restrictions made him sort of a God to blue state republicans who resented the lockdowns, as well as Cubans and Venezuelans who are always weary of an overbearing government. \n\nHe\u2019s always had a supermajority legislature and been able to pass whatever he wants at his whim. All these \u201cpolitical victories\u201d really aren\u2019t his. Hell, he could\u2019ve vetoed all those bills and they still would\u2019ve passed, that\u2019s how republican the legislature is. Republicans loved him not because he was charismatic, but because he was zooming all these incredibly conservative bills through and signing them into law at lightning speed. That\u2019s something he was never going to be able to replicate at the national level. At best, he\u2019d have 52 or 53 out of 100 senators, and he\u2019d have to contend with Susan Collins, Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, and some others who wouldn\u2019t be so eager to push through all his toxic culture war stuff. The house would be a pure toss up every election cycle, unlike the Florida house where most GOP reps are gerrymandered in safely. \n\nPeople wanted DeSantis to do nationally what he did in Florida. Unfortunately for DeSantis, turning congress into a Republican super machine like the Florida legislature isn\u2019t possible. I think DeSantis and his modus operandi also offered a contrast to our federal government. Here was DeSantis, pushing through a highly conservative agenda at lightning speed, all while our federal government is ground to a halt. Of course, the numbers are very different, but on the surface, DeSantis was the efficiency a lot of these people wish they could see in the federal government, even though he really didn\u2019t have to do much to achieve this.",

We are in trouble and no one is paying attention to it. \n\nHere is what some of Kennedy\u2019s platform is. \n\nEconomic Reforms and Labor Rights\n\n\t\u2022\tIncrease the Minimum Wage to $15: This policy aims to elevate the national minimum wage to a level equivalent to its purchasing power in 1967, providing a living wage for millions of workers.\n\t\u2022\tProsecute Union-Busting Corporations: To strengthen workers\u2019 rights, Kennedy proposes legal actions against companies that unlawfully interfere with employees\u2019 rights to organize and negotiate for better wages and working conditions.\n\nHousing and Homeownership\n\n\t\u2022\tSupport Affordable Homeownership: Through backing 3% home mortgage bonds with tax-free status, Kennedy\u2019s plan would significantly lower mortgage rates, making homeownership more accessible to average Americans.\n\t\u2022\tUtilize Vacant Lands and Properties: By incentivizing local governments to bring city-owned land and buildings back into use, Kennedy aims to increase housing supply and reduce costs.\n\t\u2022\tZoning Law Changes and Tax Code Reform: Encouraging municipalities to allow more ancillary dwelling units and making investment in single-family homes less attractive for large corporations are part of Kennedy\u2019s strategy to boost homeownership and control rental prices.\n\nEnergy and Small Business Support\n\n\t\u2022\tCut Energy Prices: By limiting natural gas exports, Kennedy aims to reduce domestic energy costs, easing financial pressure on households and businesses.\n\t\u2022\tShift Regulatory Focus: Proposes shifting regulatory scrutiny from small to large corporations, supporting small businesses by reducing undue regulatory burdens.\n\nImmigration and Trade\n\n\t\u2022\tSecure the Borders: Aims to halt illegal immigration to prevent wage undercutting by undocumented workers.\n\t\u2022\tProtect American Workers through Trade Deals: Kennedy intends to negotiate trade agreements that prevent low-wage countries from undermining American labor standards.\n\nMilitary Spending and Domestic Funding\n\n\t\u2022\tReduce Military Expenditures: By curbing military spending, Kennedy plans to redirect funds towards critical domestic programs like infrastructure, healthcare, and education.\n\nHealthcare and Chronic Disease\n\n\t\u2022\tAddress the Chronic Disease Epidemic: Kennedy\u2019s plan includes measures to tackle the chronic disease burden that significantly impacts American families and the economy.\n\nCorruption and Corporate Influence\n\n\t\u2022\tEradicate Corruption: Aims to clean out corruption in Washington, D.C., focusing on ending practices that favor large corporations and billionaires at the expense of the general public.\n\nEducation and Student Debt\n\n\t\u2022\tAddiction Healing Centers: Proposes the creation of addiction healing centers on organic farms as a novel approach to addiction recovery.\n\t\u2022\tReform Student Debt: Making student debt dischargeable in bankruptcy and reducing interest rates to zero are among Kennedy\u2019s proposals to alleviate the student debt crisis.\n\nDrug Costs\n\n\t\u2022\tHalve Drug Costs: Kennedy\u2019s plan to cut drug costs by half seeks to bring U.S. drug prices in line with those in other countries, easing the financial burden on American consumers.\n\nEnvironmental Protection\n\n\t\u2022\tProtect the Environment: Leveraging his background as an environmental lawyer, Kennedy aims to enforce stricter regulations against polluters and protect natural resources.\n\nSounds pretty great to me.",

            "I'm of two minds about it. I'll sometimes see Trump say something and think \"God, what a fascist!\" But I don't think this is genuine old-school 1930s fascism. I think it's something... else. It's even weirder than that.\n\nFor example, you'll hear liberals say that Trump will destroy the system, and that's we have to vote to stop him. There are some people who vote for Trump because they think he will! But actually, I think he'll do what he did last time: appoint more arch-conservative judges -- who will be there for many years after him -- while posting on Truth Social and eating hamburgers and derailing policy meetings with his advisors by going on 45-minute tangents about hot babes on private planes.\n\nThat just isn't Nazi Germany, which I do think really tried to mobilize Germans and create the sense that they were living in a \"great age.\" In MAGA, I see a nihilistic and atomized society run by people who seek to fuel mutual distrust and deep indifference. The idea is to make people passive, not mass mobilization like in a totalitarian regime. The only thing that matters is making money and avoiding how to be ripped off by other people.\u00a0The actual result is cynicism, fatalism, and apathy. A bit like Putin's Russia.\n\nBut it's for this reason they need some \"excess\" to make it \"work.\" They have to dress themselves up to create the image that what they're doing is some great drama. There's a movie called Iron Sky, which is a satirical movie about a Nazi invasion from the moon (complete with flying saucers), and there's one scene where Sarah Palin (who is the president) needs to juice her poll numbers so she [hires some Nazis](https://youtu.be/C-VglGOKR3E?si=lCHN2bwxTl4JW7L6) as contractors to write speeches for her -- this turns out to be popular.

Even if the campaign defense is true that Trump didn't personally approve of the message, the fact that he attracts the kind of people who find the message of a \"unified reich\" compelling is by itself concerning. The dog whistle has been there for decades, but now it's becoming louder to the humans.\n\n>Do you think there is a genuine old school 1930s-era fascist threat from Trump and his associates?\n\nI think that's the wrong framing. The thing about fascism is that it's ideologically slippery and forms to fit into whatever the current context is. I don't, for example, think that Donald Trump is going to lean into eugenics, which was a much more popular pseudoscience in the 30s, talk about purifying the white race ([though there are plenty in his orbit who do talk like that](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gop-leaders-denounce-greene-gosar-speaking-white-nationalist-event-rcna18050)), and start a bunch of death camps.\n\nWhat we do know is that Trump taps into a lot of popular outrage and has a very authoritarian bent. He cares not for norms and laws, except how they might be exploited for his own power. We've had 4 years of him being in office to see that explicitly, as well as the last 3 1/2 years of him continuing to use bad faith rhetoric and actions to exploit the systems trying to hold him accountable for his laundry list of wrongdoing, both in and out of office. At the very least, the attempted self-coup to subvert the 2020 election and remain in office demonstrate a minimum threshold for how far Donald Trump is willing to go to arrogate power to himself at the expense of the Republic which he seeks office under. For that reason alone, the prospect of a second Trump presidency should be incredibly concerning for anyone who cares about the continued stability and legitimacy of the United States.\n\nBeyond the doomsday scenario of a President-made-King (which does echo what Hitler and Mussolini did in the 1930s, when they leveraged parliamentary office into becoming dictators with indefinite tenure), what might a 2025 Trump Administration look like? For a start, we can expect him to continue along the same paths that he went down starting in 2017. We can expect the Federal government to corruptly hand out key administration posts to captains of industry with the intent to deregulate those industries for private profit. Expect the EPA to cast a blind eye to polluters. Expect a rollback of greenhouse gas controls. As an extension to that, expect foreign affairs to once again be an out-and-out exercise in wielding diplomatic power for private profit and personal gain. We saw Trump try to leverage Ukraine's relationship with the US to neuter a political opponent, which led to his first impeachment, as an example.\n\nExpect a second-term Trump to continue trying to subvert the professional civil service to bend it to his political and personal will. We saw the first attempts at that late in his first term with the attempted implementation of Schedule F, which would have turned any career employee who has any say in Federal policy turned into an at-will excepted service employee subject to the President's dismissal without due process. Rather than a civil service dedicated to the Republic and executing the rule of law (*all* laws, not just the President's orders) and the nuanced technicalities of the field they administer, you'll have an army of bureaucrats responsive to the President and the President alone.\n\nWe saw cruelty and theatrics at the border in Trump's first term, and I would expect more of the same, perhaps ramped up. Expect a slowdown or complete halting of processing of asylum and humanitarian claims, especially if they come from less wealthy or less white countries of origin, just like when Trump instituted the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy and canceled a Federal program allowing refugees from Haiti to continue remaining in the US. Expect a reinstitution of the \"zero tolerance\" illegal border crossing policy that resulted in screaming children being ripped from their mother's arms simply because the mother committed a misdemeanor criminal offense. Expect those children to be abused by a careless bureaucracy, including being kept in inhumane detention facilities. Expect a not insignificant number of those children to be repatriated back to a dangerous country in a dangerous situation, or alternatively to be fostered in the US without care given to whether they are being placed with a safe family who will care for them. Expect those children to be lost to their families forever, either through trafficking, abuse, or lost records. Going a step beyond what Trump I did, expect Trump II to build camps (perhaps rephrased to a more placid sounding \"emergency detention facilities\" or some such term) for any and all suspected or confirmed illegal aliens. Expect lawful asylum seekers who do make it through the border to be sent to these camps, rather than released on their own recognizance while waiting for an immigration hearing. Expect ICE to be involved, but also expect state and local law enforcement to be deputized by ICE and given free rein to detain anyone within their jurisdictions that they suspect to be in the United States unlawfully. Expect those detainees to be given no legal recourse, even if their suspected immigration status was in error. Expect the conditions in those facilities to be inhumane, and expect them to be built with emergency funds on corrupt contracts funneled to Trump's boosters and family.\n\nI live in Portland and saw firsthand the Trump administration's response to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. Over the wishes both the state and the city, Trump sent various DHS units to Portland to \"protect the Federal courthouse and other Federal offices in downtown Portland.\" These officers in unmarked cars and displaying no markings identifying them as law enforcement abducted isolated citizens not engaged in any criminal conduct or imminently threatening Federal facilities off the streets. We're lucky that no one was shot on either end of those interactions. We also saw heavy-handed Federal police tactics in other cities and at other times, such as when Trump cleared Lafayette Square so that he could have a photo opp (hint: the point of the activity was not the photo, it was the demonstration of power against liberal protestors for his base of supporters). In 2025, I expect to see mass protests all over the country if Trump is inaugurated, and I expect Trump escalate his previous tactics to quickly invoke the Insurrection Act, quickly deploy available military units, including the National Guard, and impose some kind of martial law and occupation on \"lawless Democratic cities.\" I hesitate to speculate on what happens after that, but I can't imagine anything good.\n\nThose are just the things off the top of my head. Does that resemble in 1930s fascism? In some ways, sure, but not in other ways. Are we going to have roaming bands of brownshirts and blackshirts? Probably not (though I imagine the Proud Boys and Oathkeepers might make some noise in isolated cases). Will we see concentration camps to detain and segregate \"others?\" I would bet on it, especially in the immigration realm. Will we see a more authoritarian Federal government, with various liberal institutions being eroded or outright dismantled? That's a 100% guarantee.\n\nFinally, I'd like to point out that the Heritage Foundation has put together a combination wish list, road map, and detailed plan for imposing a conservative policy agenda on the country, called [Project 2025](https://www.project2025.org/) ([associated Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025#Policies)). While the Heritage Foundation has been publishing these \"Mandates for Leadership\" for 40 years, Project 2025 stands out for its ambition and desire to entirely overhaul effectively every part of the Federal Government. It was heavily influenced by the lessons learned in the first Trump administration and, while written in a way that was technically generic, has a second Trump term, or at least a Trump-like term, specifically in mind. A President Trump would by no means be *required* to hew to what's in Project 2025, I expect there to be relatively little deviation from it. Go ahead and skim through it. If you're not a fan of fascism in general, it should scare the bejeezus out of you.",
            "Yesterday I misunderstood the source of that 'unified reich' text that appeared in the video. I assumed it was an article from somewhere (which really would be just as bad but I digress) that the employee copied and pasted into the video without really paying attention.\n\nBut nope!

As uncomfortable as I may be with Biden's garden variety socialism, in my view one must vote for Biden as a stop-gap against Trump and his fascist goals.  If Trump is re-elected, or if he succeeds in his plan to not heed the vote, then the Constitution as we know it is over.  Trump has made that crystal clear.  If my fellow Americans who are Republicans and subscribe to Republican values and platform positions wanted me to consider voting for the Republican, then they should have nominated someone who is not transparently seeking the end of the Rule of Law.\n\n  \nA book that has helped me through all of this is called \"The Ominous Parallels\".    It was published in the early 80s by an associate of Ayn Rand named Leonard Peikoff and (whether you like her philosophy or dislike it) does an eerily excellent job of laying out pre-WWII Germany, 1970s US, and the parallels between the two.  This is the book that did the most to help me recognize the language of right-wing statism coming out of Trump's mouth, and (critically) out of the mouths of his supporters in the media.  I wonder if Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Beck et. al. understand the extent of their contributions to Mr. Trump's efforts to undermine the rule of Law.   Ironically the author of the Ominous Parallels himself tragically voiced support for voting for Trump in 2020.  It's not as though he didn't warn us in his book that in a situation where there is plenty of intellectual bankruptcy to go around, particularly bankruptcy in our most fundamental philosophic thinking, that a dictator could arise and come to power.  It has made some sense to me that otherwise rational highly intelligent people would seem to shock us by falling into the trap of allowing Biden to be so demonized that they will vote for anyone against him, but I can't help but say it is terribly disappointing that this happened to Peikoff.",

            "Trump is \"claiming\" that a staffer did the repost. Probably complete bullshit. It's almost guaranteed that Trump approved it, if he didn't actually repost it himself. Others claim that the reposted video is misinterpreted and that the quote precedes Nazi Germany. That may be true. But that doesn't matter. What Trump and company wanted to do was to signal their Nazi cult members, which are many, that they support them and that they, in turn, should support him. Trump and company realize, only too well, that their cult members are not intelligent enough to understand the history of that quote.",

            "Unified Reich is Trump's racist dog whistle to the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, KKK, and American Nazi Party to solidify his base.   It put him in a small bit of a pickle with non-MAGA Republicans which allowed Nikki Haley to broker a deal.    The deal is as follows - Trump got Haley's soft endorsement (announced today) in return for being added to the MAGA ticket.  That will be announced in 2 weeks after the jury results of the NYC trial are announced.   Nikki is first required to denounce the judge and prosecutor in the case that results in his guilty verdict.\n\nTrump took advantage of Haley, since he knew she is so ambitious that she would sell her soul to be VP, even after Trump insulted her, her husband, her family, and her voters.   She doesn't care.  She will flip-flop and sell out her parents to get political success.    \n\nSee these movies\n\nDonald Trump \"High Plains Grifter\"\n\nNikki Haley \"For a Few Dollars More\"",

Especially when people express their discontent with MAGA, Trump and Conservative Agenda and its Ideology.     \n\nThere has to be some covert agenda going on, to try and omit and diminish people calling out the acts and actions of MAGA and Right Wingers, as if they want to void out commentary.  It's in many ways no different than the J6 Deniers, and the Deniers of the Criminality of Trump  who want to make sure only right wing narrative are promoted and viewable.",

            "1.  another thing I've noticed is that supporters of Trump attempt to portray him as \"winning on the issues\".  There should be no discussion of whether Trump wins or loses on issues, because he has shown that he is hostile to the Constitution and the rule of Law and will trash them at the first opportunity.  Why argue about specific issues at the point of a gun, or when the rule of law is being threatened?    \n  \nTrump seems to be completely committed to destroying the US voting system (naturally under guise of being concerned about the \"fairness\" of the vote).  Why argue about whom to vote for if one of the candidates is so clearly committed to not respecting the vote outcome, and to undermining the voting system itself?  \n\nIf Republicans wanted me to consider voting for their candidate, they should have nominated someone who would respect basic legal principles.\n\n2.  Another thing I've noticed all these years, which is probably also taken from the would-be fascist dictator playbook, is the extraordinary vilification of Trump's opponents.  Both Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden have received this treatment.  As long as they can be made out to be so evil that nobody should vote for them, then Trump can be the recipient of more votes.  Yet Biden in particular has not shown the disrespect for the rule of law that Trump has.  Thus, I can consider voting for him, much as I may dislike some of his stances on the issues.",

            "**Title: Exploring Parallels: Trump, Project 2025, and Historical Comparisons**\n\n**Introduction:**\nIn contemporary political discourse, comparisons between historical events and present-day movements often prompt intense debates. One such comparison gaining attention is the perceived resemblance between Trump's administration, Project 2025, and the Republican Party with elements of Hitler's Nazi Party. This analysis aims to delve into these comparisons objectively, examining ideologies, policies, and societal impacts to evaluate their validity and implications for the future.\n\n**Consolidation of Power:**\n*Historical Context:*\nThe failed Beer Hall Putsch and Hitler's subsequent rise to Chancellorship in Germany are notable historical events showcasing power consolidation by the Nazi Party.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nDrawing parallels, Project 2025, initiated by The Heritage Foundation, aims to establish a comprehensive conservative agenda. Comparisons have been made between Trump's leadership style and Hitler's consolidation of power, raising concerns about civil rights protections and government restructuring.\n\n**Civil Rights and Contraception Ban:**\n*Historical Context:*\nUnder Hitler, strict gender roles and contraception bans were enforced, reflecting authoritarian control over societal norms.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nSimilarly, Project 2025 proposes control over body autonomy and contraception, emphasizing traditional family dynamics and religious ideologies, raising concerns about gender equality and discrimination protections.\n\n**Religious Nationalism:**\n*Historical Context:*\nHitler's use of Christianity to justify extremist views and policies is a historical precedent showcasing religious nationalism in politics.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nProject 2025 advocates for infusing government with Christian elements, promoting traditional roles and restricting reproductive rights, echoing historical rhetoric used to justify authoritarian measures.\n\n**The Pillars:**\n*Historical Context:*\nThe Third Reich's pillars included backlash against societal changes, anti-communism, nationalism, and resentment post-World War I.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nProject 2025's pillars reflect a consensus view on governance, personnel database management, education, and transition planning, raising concerns about authoritarian tendencies and suppression of dissent.\n\n**A New Police State:**\n*Historical Context:*\nThe Gestapo's brutal tactics and the SS's paramilitary control exemplify historical police state measures under the Third Reich.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nConcerns about Project 2025 leading to a police state in the U.S. are raised, reflecting fears of authoritarian control and suppression of freedoms.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis of Project 2025 reveals parallels to historical events that led to totalitarian regimes. While comparisons provide insights, it's crucial to approach these discussions with objectivity and respect for differing perspectives. By understanding these parallels, we can advocate for democratic values and human rights to prevent erosion of freedoms in modern politics.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://michiganadvance.com/2024/01/16/project-2025-if-allowed-will-cement-america-as-a-rightwing-authoritarian-state/\n\nhttps://www.project2025.org/playbook/\n\nhttps://ghdi.ghi-dc.org/sub_image.cfm?image_id=2048\n\nhttps://www.project2025.org/\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinder,_K%C3%BCche,_Kirche\n\nhttps://msmagazine.com/2024/02/08/project-2025-conservative-right-wing-trump-woke/\n\nhttps://www.dailysignal.com/2023/04/20/4-pillars-project-2025-conservative-plan-undermine-liberal-behemoth-washington/amp/\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Nazi-belts-have-God-with-us-engraved\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/26/what-is-project-2025-trump\n\nhttps://www.heritage.org/press/project-2025-continues-grow-60-partners-preparing-next-presidential-administration\n\nhttps://www.project2025.org/policy/\n\nhttps://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/03/donald-trump-hitler-similarities\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/trump-social-media-account-video-unified-reich/\n\nhttps://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2024/03/13/trump-hitler-putin-kim-jong-un-john-kelly\n\nhttps://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4677700-trumps-latest-flirtation-with-nazi-symbolism-draws-criticism/",
            "Project 2025 is the American version of Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf. Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers Party aka the Nazi Party. The Beer Hall Putsch in 1923, Hitler and his SA \u201cbrown shirts\u201d have made themselves known, and as a result he was thrown in prison where he wrote the book Mein Kampf\u2026outlining all of the plans to consolidate power to the Nazi Party and to Hitler himself by force and violence, to dismantle and abolish the Weimar Republic, and to remove protections of discrimination of certain groups Hitler deemed inferior (Jews, Gypsies, Communists, Bolsheviks, Homosexuals, people with physical and mental disabilitie, and many more), and exterminate them from his Reich. Also for women, body autonomy and abortion was verboten (forbidden)\u2026as Hitler believed that women\u2019s primary roles in Nazi Germany was to the children, kitchen, and church, and that women are to have a bunch of offspring so to purify his Aryan Master Race, for soldiers to fight for Germany, and for wives and mothers to become mere baby factories. Also regarding the Christian nationalism as stated in Project 2025\u2026Hitler also mentions a very interesting similar view when it came to Christianity in Nazi Germany. Hitler has put in that book that he himself believes he is doing the will of God regarding his Nazi ideology more than once. Then people started reading Mein Kampf and it soon became the Bible of Nazi Germany and led to Hitler becoming Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and the Final Solution to be put into work, leading extreme discrimination, torture, and systematically murdering millions in concentration camps\u2026while those who survived were scarred forever living in Hell, and ultimately the Second World War. All because of ONE MAN and his book \u201cMein Kampf\u201d, or to be more specific based on current events,Project 1933. Mein Kampf Project 1933 was not just his autobiography, but a very detailed plan of establishing a fascist mass genocidal dictatorship\u2026which very suspiciously and coincidently \u00a0strongly parallels the modern Project 2025, also involving forceful consolidation of power to the Republican Party, the Executive Branch, and the Republican President; the dismantling of the government, the removal of protections against discrimination of LGBTQ, People of Color, Women, Jews, Muslims, Immigrants, and many more, and the Christian nationalism that Hitler and the Nazi Party enforced with brutality, violence, and murder. Project 2025 is the American version of Mein Kampf also known as Project 1933.\u00a0",

The law aims to produce lower odds of recidivism by incentivizing incarcerated individuals to engage in rigorous, evidence-based rehabilitation and education programming. In exchange and based on a favorable assessment of risk to the community, they may earn an earlier opportunity for release to community corrections.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDoesn\u2019t sound fascist to me!",

Hitler legitimately had aspirations to make Germany the world's most powerful nation, and to transform it into an empire. Trump ultimately does not care about making America a stronger nation or more respected on the world stage (as evidenced by his actions), he cares about acquiring those things *for himself*.\n\nHe doesn't care about using the role of Commander in Chief of the world's most powerful military to advance America's goals worldwide -he cares about using it to make *he himself* the singular most powerful man on the planet.\n\nHe doesn't care about using the platform / bully pulpit of the US Presidency to inspire, lead, and shape the values of its people - he cares about all the attention and respect it garners *him*. \n\nHe doesn't care about POTUS' status as the \"final arbiter\" of what legislation becomes legally binding in America - he cares about how it makes people vie for *his* approval and grovel for *his* permission. \n\nHe doesn't care about the Executive's ability to nominate judges who will enforce the nation's laws fairly, equally, and without bias - he cares about being able to use it to essentially make *himself* immune to any and all consequences. \n\nThe man is *entirely* ego. It's why the GOP has continually found him so hard to quit - he truly has no guiding ideological compass or principles, and will sign or do anything that feeds his insatiable hunger for attention, power, and respect. He's a blank check for whatever policy preferences you want to advance, so long as you satisfy those conditions. \n\nMost fascist dictators throughout history have held the obsession with power, control, and violence because they believed they alone had the vision necessary to transform their nation into the shape they desired - and they needed that power and control to do so. Donald Trump's obsession with power, control, and violence instead stems from a pathological need to feed his ego - to *feel* powerful; to *feel* a sense of control over other people. \n\nIn other words - IMO - Trump's obsessions with all the aspects of fascism don't stem from a desire to wield them to transform the nation in his image, they stem from a *need* to use them to feed his all-devouring ego.",

            "I'm of two minds about it. I'll sometimes see Trump say something and think \"God, what a fascist!\" But I don't think this is genuine old-school 1930s fascism. I think it's something... else. It's even weirder than that.\n\nFor example, you'll hear liberals say that Trump will destroy the system, and that's we have to vote to stop him. There are some people who vote for Trump because they think he will! But actually, I think he'll do what he did last time: appoint more arch-conservative judges -- who will be there for many years after him -- while posting on Truth Social and eating hamburgers and derailing policy meetings with his advisors by going on 45-minute tangents about hot babes on private planes.\n\nThat just isn't Nazi Germany, which I do think really tried to mobilize Germans and create the sense that they were living in a \"great age.\" In MAGA, I see a nihilistic and atomized society run by people who seek to fuel mutual distrust and deep indifference. The idea is to make people passive, not mass mobilization like in a totalitarian regime. The only thing that matters is making money and avoiding how to be ripped off by other people.\u00a0The actual result is cynicism, fatalism, and apathy. A bit like Putin's Russia.\n\nBut it's for this reason they need some \"excess\" to make it \"work.\" They have to dress themselves up to create the image that what they're doing is some great drama.

Even if the campaign defense is true that Trump didn't personally approve of the message, the fact that he attracts the kind of people who find the message of a \"unified reich\" compelling is by itself concerning. The dog whistle has been there for decades, but now it's becoming louder to the humans.\n\n>Do you think there is a genuine old school 1930s-era fascist threat from Trump and his associates?\n\nI think that's the wrong framing. The thing about fascism is that it's ideologically slippery and forms to fit into whatever the current context is. I don't, for example, think that Donald Trump is going to lean into eugenics, which was a much more popular pseudoscience in the 30s, talk about purifying the white race ([though there are plenty in his orbit who do talk like that](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gop-leaders-denounce-greene-gosar-speaking-white-nationalist-event-rcna18050)), and start a bunch of death camps.\n\nWhat we do know is that Trump taps into a lot of popular outrage and has a very authoritarian bent. He cares not for norms and laws, except how they might be exploited for his own power. We've had 4 years of him being in office to see that explicitly, as well as the last 3 1/2 years of him continuing to use bad faith rhetoric and actions to exploit the systems trying to hold him accountable for his laundry list of wrongdoing, both in and out of office. At the very least, the attempted self-coup to subvert the 2020 election and remain in office demonstrate a minimum threshold for how far Donald Trump is willing to go to arrogate power to himself at the expense of the Republic which he seeks office under. For that reason alone, the prospect of a second Trump presidency should be incredibly concerning for anyone who cares about the continued stability and legitimacy of the United States.\n\nBeyond the doomsday scenario of a President-made-King (which does echo what Hitler and Mussolini did in the 1930s, when they leveraged parliamentary office into becoming dictators with indefinite tenure), what might a 2025 Trump Administration look like? For a start, we can expect him to continue along the same paths that he went down starting in 2017. We can expect the Federal government to corruptly hand out key administration posts to captains of industry with the intent to deregulate those industries for private profit. Expect the EPA to cast a blind eye to polluters. Expect a rollback of greenhouse gas controls. As an extension to that, expect foreign affairs to once again be an out-and-out exercise in wielding diplomatic power for private profit and personal gain. We saw Trump try to leverage Ukraine's relationship with the US to neuter a political opponent, which led to his first impeachment, as an example.\n\nExpect a second-term Trump to continue trying to subvert the professional civil service to bend it to his political and personal will. We saw the first attempts at that late in his first term with the attempted implementation of Schedule F, which would have turned any career employee who has any say in Federal policy turned into an at-will excepted service employee subject to the President's dismissal without due process. Rather than a civil service dedicated to the Republic and executing the rule of law (*all* laws, not just the President's orders) and the nuanced technicalities of the field they administer, you'll have an army of bureaucrats responsive to the President and the President alone.\n\nWe saw cruelty and theatrics at the border in Trump's first term, and I would expect more of the same, perhaps ramped up. Expect a slowdown or complete halting of processing of asylum and humanitarian claims, especially if they come from less wealthy or less white countries of origin, just like when Trump instituted the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy and canceled a Federal program allowing refugees from Haiti to continue remaining in the US. Expect a reinstitution of the \"zero tolerance\" illegal border crossing policy that resulted in screaming children being ripped from their mother's arms simply because the mother committed a misdemeanor criminal offense. Expect those children to be abused by a careless bureaucracy, including being kept in inhumane detention facilities. Expect a not insignificant number of those children to be repatriated back to a dangerous country in a dangerous situation, or alternatively to be fostered in the US without care given to whether they are being placed with a safe family who will care for them. Expect those children to be lost to their families forever, either through trafficking, abuse, or lost records. Going a step beyond what Trump I did, expect Trump II to build camps (perhaps rephrased to a more placid sounding \"emergency detention facilities\" or some such term) for any and all suspected or confirmed illegal aliens. Expect lawful asylum seekers who do make it through the border to be sent to these camps, rather than released on their own recognizance while waiting for an immigration hearing. Expect ICE to be involved, but also expect state and local law enforcement to be deputized by ICE and given free rein to detain anyone within their jurisdictions that they suspect to be in the United States unlawfully. Expect those detainees to be given no legal recourse, even if their suspected immigration status was in error. Expect the conditions in those facilities to be inhumane, and expect them to be built with emergency funds on corrupt contracts funneled to Trump's boosters and family.\n\nI live in Portland and saw firsthand the Trump administration's response to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. Over the wishes both the state and the city, Trump sent various DHS units to Portland to \"protect the Federal courthouse and other Federal offices in downtown Portland.\" These officers in unmarked cars and displaying no markings identifying them as law enforcement abducted isolated citizens not engaged in any criminal conduct or imminently threatening Federal facilities off the streets. We're lucky that no one was shot on either end of those interactions. We also saw heavy-handed Federal police tactics in other cities and at other times, such as when Trump cleared Lafayette Square so that he could have a photo opp (hint: the point of the activity was not the photo, it was the demonstration of power against liberal protestors for his base of supporters). In 2025, I expect to see mass protests all over the country if Trump is inaugurated, and I expect Trump escalate his previous tactics to quickly invoke the Insurrection Act, quickly deploy available military units, including the National Guard, and impose some kind of martial law and occupation on \"lawless Democratic cities.\" I hesitate to speculate on what happens after that, but I can't imagine anything good.\n\nThose are just the things off the top of my head. Does that resemble in 1930s fascism? In some ways, sure, but not in other ways. Are we going to have roaming bands of brownshirts and blackshirts? Probably not (though I imagine the Proud Boys and Oathkeepers might make some noise in isolated cases). Will we see concentration camps to detain and segregate \"others?\" I would bet on it, especially in the immigration realm. Will we see a more authoritarian Federal government, with various liberal institutions being eroded or outright dismantled? That's a 100% guarantee.\n\nFinally, I'd like to point out that the Heritage Foundation has put together a combination wish list, road map, and detailed plan for imposing a conservative policy agenda on the country, called [Project 2025](https://www.project2025.org/) ([associated Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025#Policies)). While the Heritage Foundation has been publishing these \"Mandates for Leadership\" for 40 years, Project 2025 stands out for its ambition and desire to entirely overhaul effectively every part of the Federal Government. It was heavily influenced by the lessons learned in the first Trump administration and, while written in a way that was technically generic, has a second Trump term, or at least a Trump-like term, specifically in mind. A President Trump would by no means be *required* to hew to what's in Project 2025, I expect there to be relatively little deviation from it. Go ahead and skim through it.

I assumed it was an article from somewhere (which really would be just as bad but I digress) that the employee copied and pasted into the video without really paying attention.\n\nBut nope! Someone hired by the trump team was given specific instructions on making a video, and what they did to follow the instructions was to generate it from scratch, to type the words \"unified reich\" and to make it look like a headline and compose the image to look like a newspaper. \n\nWhatever their instructions were these words were absolutely used intentionally.",
            "when Trump was elected in 2016, I thought that some of his wording, behavior, etc. seemed pretty clearly textbook  statist would-be violent ruler.\n\nIn 2020 what I told my Jewish family and friends was that we didn't have that many jobs coming out of Hebrew School, but that \"not voting for the next Hitler\" and speaking out against him was pretty clearly one of them, and that  those who vote for Trump did not apparently take that \"never again\" stuff very seriously.  The one thing I was grateful for was that Trump made his Constitution-wrecking intentions pretty obvious from the start (in my opinion).  \n\n[edited]\nI was always worried that if the moment of truth came for me as a voter, where I had to stand up against a threat to the Rule of Law, I would not be entirely sure whom to oppose and whom to support.  But in the case of the 2016, 2020 and 2024 elections, the matter is quite clear to me.  As uncomfortable as I may be with Biden's garden variety socialism, in my view one must vote for Biden as a stop-gap against Trump and his fascist goals.  If Trump is re-elected, or if he succeeds in his plan to not heed the vote, then the Constitution as we know it is over.  Trump has made that crystal clear.  If my fellow Americans who are Republicans and subscribe to Republican values and platform positions wanted me to consider voting for the Republican, then they should have nominated someone who is not transparently seeking the end of the Rule of Law.\n\n  \nA book that has helped me through all of this is called \"The Ominous Parallels\".    It was published in the early 80s by an associate of Ayn Rand named Leonard Peikoff and (whether you like her philosophy or dislike it) does an eerily excellent job of laying out pre-WWII Germany, 1970s US, and the parallels between the two.  This is the book that did the most to help me recognize the language of right-wing statism coming out of Trump's mouth, and (critically) out of the mouths of his supporters in the media.  I wonder if Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Beck et. al. understand the extent of their contributions to Mr. Trump's efforts to undermine the rule of Law.   Ironically the author of the Ominous Parallels himself tragically voiced support for voting for Trump in 2020.  It's not as though he didn't warn us in his book that in a situation where there is plenty of intellectual bankruptcy to go around, particularly bankruptcy in our most fundamental philosophic thinking, that a dictator could arise and come to power.  It has made some sense to me that otherwise rational highly intelligent people would seem to shock us by falling into the trap of allowing Biden to be so demonized that they will vote for anyone against him, but I can't help but say it is terribly disappointing that this happened to Peikoff.",

That will be announced in 2 weeks after the jury results of the NYC trial are announced.   Nikki is first required to denounce the judge and prosecutor in the case that results in his guilty verdict.\n\nTrump took advantage of Haley, since he knew she is so ambitious that she would sell her soul to be VP, even after Trump insulted her, her husband, her family, and her voters.   She doesn't care.  She will flip-flop and sell out her parents to get political success.    \n\nSee these movies\n\nDonald Trump \"High Plains Grifter\"\n\nNikki Haley \"For a Few Dollars More\"",

There should be no discussion of whether Trump wins or loses on issues, because he has shown that he is hostile to the Constitution and the rule of Law and will trash them at the first opportunity.  Why argue about specific issues at the point of a gun, or when the rule of law is being threatened?    \n  \nTrump seems to be completely committed to destroying the US voting system (naturally under guise of being concerned about the \"fairness\" of the vote).  Why argue about whom to vote for if one of the candidates is so clearly committed to not respecting the vote outcome, and to undermining the voting system itself?  \n\nIf Republicans wanted me to consider voting for their candidate, they should have nominated someone who would respect basic legal principles.\n\n2.  Another thing I've noticed all these years, which is probably also taken from the would-be fascist dictator playbook, is the extraordinary vilification of Trump's opponents.  Both Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden have received this treatment.  As long as they can be made out to be so evil that nobody should vote for them, then Trump can be the recipient of more votes.  Yet Biden in particular has not shown the disrespect for the rule of law that Trump has.  Thus, I can consider voting for him, much as I may dislike some of his stances on the issues.",

            "**Title: Exploring Parallels: Trump, Project 2025, and Historical Comparisons**\n\n**Introduction:**\nIn contemporary political discourse, comparisons between historical events and present-day movements often prompt intense debates. One such comparison gaining attention is the perceived resemblance between Trump's administration, Project 2025, and the Republican Party with elements of Hitler's Nazi Party. This analysis aims to delve into these comparisons objectively, examining ideologies, policies, and societal impacts to evaluate their validity and implications for the future.\n\n**Consolidation of Power:**\n*Historical Context:*\nThe failed Beer Hall Putsch and Hitler's subsequent rise to Chancellorship in Germany are notable historical events showcasing power consolidation by the Nazi Party.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nDrawing parallels, Project 2025, initiated by The Heritage Foundation, aims to establish a comprehensive conservative agenda. Comparisons have been made between Trump's leadership style and Hitler's consolidation of power, raising concerns about civil rights protections and government restructuring.\n\n**Civil Rights and Contraception Ban:**\n*Historical Context:*\nUnder Hitler, strict gender roles and contraception bans were enforced, reflecting authoritarian control over societal norms.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nSimilarly, Project 2025 proposes control over body autonomy and contraception, emphasizing traditional family dynamics and religious ideologies, raising concerns about gender equality and discrimination protections.\n\n**Religious Nationalism:**\n*Historical Context:*\nHitler's use of Christianity to justify extremist views and policies is a historical precedent showcasing religious nationalism in politics.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nProject 2025 advocates for infusing government with Christian elements, promoting traditional roles and restricting reproductive rights, echoing historical rhetoric used to justify authoritarian measures.\n\n**The Pillars:**\n*Historical Context:*\nThe Third Reich's pillars included backlash against societal changes, anti-communism, nationalism, and resentment post-World War I.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nProject 2025's pillars reflect a consensus view on governance, personnel database management, education, and transition planning, raising concerns about authoritarian tendencies and suppression of dissent.\n\n**A New Police State:**\n*Historical Context:*\nThe Gestapo's brutal tactics and the SS's paramilitary control exemplify historical police state measures under the Third Reich.\n\n*Modern Parallels:*\nConcerns about Project 2025 leading to a police state in the U.S. are raised, reflecting fears of authoritarian control and suppression of freedoms.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis of Project 2025 reveals parallels to historical events that led to totalitarian regimes. While comparisons provide insights, it's crucial to approach these discussions with objectivity and respect for differing perspectives. By understanding these parallels, we can advocate for democratic values and human rights to prevent erosion of freedoms in modern politics.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://michiganadvance.com/2024/01/16/project-2025-if-allowed-will-cement-america-as-a-rightwing-authoritarian-state/\n\nhttps://www.project2025.org/playbook/\n\nhttps://ghdi.ghi-dc.org/sub_image.cfm?image_id=2048\n\nhttps://www.project2025.org/\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinder,_K%C3%BCche,_Kirche\n\nhttps://msmagazine.com/2024/02/08/project-2025-conservative-right-wing-trump-woke/\n\nhttps://www.dailysignal.com/2023/04/20/4-pillars-project-2025-conservative-plan-undermine-liberal-behemoth-washington/amp/\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Nazi-belts-have-God-with-us-engraved\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/26/what-is-project-2025-trump\n\nhttps://www.heritage.org/press/project-2025-continues-grow-60-partners-preparing-next-presidential-administration\n\nhttps://www.project2025.org/policy/\n\nhttps://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/03/donald-trump-hitler-similarities\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/trump-social-media-account-video-unified-reich/\n\nhttps://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2024/03/13/trump-hitler-putin-kim-jong-un-john-kelly\n\nhttps://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4677700-trumps-latest-flirtation-with-nazi-symbolism-draws-criticism/",
            "Project 2025 is the American version of Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf. Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers Party aka the Nazi Party. The Beer Hall Putsch in 1923, Hitler and his SA \u201cbrown shirts\u201d have made themselves known, and as a result he was thrown in prison where he wrote the book Mein Kampf\u2026outlining all of the plans to consolidate power to the Nazi Party and to Hitler himself by force and violence, to dismantle and abolish the Weimar Republic, and to remove protections of discrimination of certain groups Hitler deemed inferior (Jews, Gypsies, Communists, Bolsheviks, Homosexuals, people with physical and mental disabilitie, and many more), and exterminate them from his Reich. Also for women, body autonomy and abortion was verboten (forbidden)\u2026as Hitler believed that women\u2019s primary roles in Nazi Germany was to the children, kitchen, and church, and that women are to have a bunch of offspring so to purify his Aryan Master Race, for soldiers to fight for Germany, and for wives and mothers to become mere baby factories. Also regarding the Christian nationalism as stated in Project 2025\u2026Hitler also mentions a very interesting similar view when it came to Christianity in Nazi Germany. Hitler has put in that book that he himself believes he is doing the will of God regarding his Nazi ideology more than once. Then people started reading Mein Kampf and it soon became the Bible of Nazi Germany and led to Hitler becoming Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and the Final Solution to be put into work, leading extreme discrimination, torture, and systematically murdering millions in concentration camps\u2026while those who survived were scarred forever living in Hell, and ultimately the Second World War. All because of ONE MAN and his book \u201cMein Kampf\u201d, or to be more specific based on current events,Project 1933. Mein Kampf Project 1933 was not just his autobiography, but a very detailed plan of establishing a fascist mass genocidal dictatorship\u2026which very suspiciously and coincidently \u00a0strongly parallels the modern Project 2025, also involving forceful consolidation of power to the Republican Party, the Executive Branch, and the Republican President; the dismantling of the government, the removal of protections against discrimination of LGBTQ, People of Color, Women, Jews, Muslims, Immigrants, and many more, and the Christian nationalism that Hitler and the Nazi Party enforced with brutality, violence, and murder. Project 2025 is the American version of Mein Kampf also known as Project 1933.\u00a0",

The law aims to produce lower odds of recidivism by incentivizing incarcerated individuals to engage in rigorous, evidence-based rehabilitation and education programming.

Hitler legitimately had aspirations to make Germany the world's most powerful nation, and to transform it into an empire. Trump ultimately does not care about making America a stronger nation or more respected on the world stage (as evidenced by his actions), he cares about acquiring those things *for himself*.\n\nHe doesn't care about using the role of Commander in Chief of the world's most powerful military to advance America's goals worldwide -he cares about using it to make *he himself* the singular most powerful man on the planet.\n\nHe doesn't care about using the platform / bully pulpit of the US Presidency to inspire, lead, and shape the values of its people - he cares about all the attention and respect it garners *him*. \n\nHe doesn't care about POTUS' status as the \"final arbiter\" of what legislation becomes legally binding in America - he cares about how it makes people vie for *his* approval and grovel for *his* permission. \n\nHe doesn't care about the Executive's ability to nominate judges who will enforce the nation's laws fairly, equally, and without bias - he cares about being able to use it to essentially make *himself* immune to any and all consequences. \n\nThe man is *entirely* ego. It's why the GOP has continually found him so hard to quit - he truly has no guiding ideological compass or principles, and will sign or do anything that feeds his insatiable hunger for attention, power, and respect. He's a blank check for whatever policy preferences you want to advance, so long as you satisfy those conditions. \n\nMost fascist dictators throughout history have held the obsession with power, control, and violence because they believed they alone had the vision necessary to transform their nation into the shape they desired - and they needed that power and control to do so. Donald Trump's obsession with power, control, and violence instead stems from a pathological need to feed his ego - to *feel* powerful; to *feel* a sense of control over other people. \n\nIn other words - IMO - Trump's obsessions with all the aspects of fascism don't stem from a desire to wield them to transform the nation in his image, they stem from a *need* to use them to feed his all-devouring ego.",

That is how he builds his brand. But, like, Dugin proposes to depopulate Russian cities because they're breeding grounds for \"degeneration, alienation and madness.\" He sounds like Pol Pot. Which is not something I think the Russian government believes in. You'll also see him come in for broadside attacks in Moskovsky Komsomlets, which is a major newspaper, so he's clearly not an untouchable figure in Russia.\n\nDugin also tries to interface with political extremists outside of Russia.

He has done this with neo-Nazis in the United States, and also a Brazilian group called Nova Resistencia which espouses a fascist ideology and praises Dugin along with Muammar Gaddafi and Julius Evola.

It's accurate. Nobody forced conservatives to nominate Trump again. Nobody forced conservatives to be such abject, immature liars. You choose to do and to be those things. Nothing I have said has been false - everything Trump said was, yet you continue to stump for the man. The handful of reasonable conservatives out there, like Justin Amash and... \n\n...Justin Amash, have been witch-hunted out of the party precisely *because* conservatives are not very nice people, to understate the reality.",

It's a very basic moral truism.\n\nWelcome to the KKK with their [America First](https://abc3340.com/resources/media2/16x9/full/1024/center/80/a6b13ee5-ffde-4078-bdf1-292a9fee0e84-large16x9_ScreenShot20210302at3.33.59PM.png) signs.  They also thought everyone entering the country with slightly darker skin is a criminal and terrorist.  Didn't occur to them that *they* were the criminals and terrorists.  Their crimes were merely \"bad apples\". \n\n>And it's just as true in the inverse, Mexico should 100% background check American citizens entering their country for the safety of their own citizens as well.\n\nWhat do you expect to find in a \"background check\"?  What kind of resources do you want to dedicate to this?  Should a visa require a few hundred hours of phone calls with several dozen people over the span of weeks for a single entry?\n\n.... Do you want to simultaneously crater any and all cross-border trade? \n\n>At no point in my comments here did I state hatred for ANY demographic nor did I ever say or suggest that white people are biologically superior (we are not)\n\n>Calling out Democrats for giving a pass to non-white criminals & terrorist factually isn't evidence that I have a problem with INNOCENT non-white people.\n\nWhat \"pass\", what the fuck are you talking about?  Yes this rhetoric has a *long* storied history of people justifying some heinous crimes against entire demographics.\n\n>1 - There hasn't been a officially proven lynching since 1981. The KKK only has 8000 members left and have done nothing for decades. The cartels are a active threat today and have 175,000+ members \n\nWhat threat?  Are you as equally concerned about the proliferation of guns, do you worry about irresponsible people with guns shooting random people coming to the door as much as you do cartels in *Mexico*?  What the fucking hell are you on about?\n\n>2 - Litterally nothing I have said suggest I want anyone to be harmed based on skin color alone. I am saying criminal trespassers should be considered a active overall threat to the country until background checked. It's why we don't care about visa overstays because they got vetted already.\n\nGuess what, Cartels have the money and resources to get visas.  What *exactly* are you worried about?  What is this supposed \"threat\"?  What the fuck are you actually on about?\n\n>Jesus explicitly said \"buy a sword\" he absolutely understood self defense.\n\nI'm sure Jesus was big on collective guilt.",

You are making huge assumptions based on your perception of things, and then making bold claims about what is actually being proposed that isn't true.\n\nSo yeah, I get that you feel the the GOP is trending in an authoritarian direction.
